?,'plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . \nthey get into an accident . \none of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . \nwhat\'s the deal ? \nwatch the movie and \" sorta \" find out . . . \ncritique : a mind-fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . \nwhich is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just didn\'t snag this one correctly . \nthey seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . \nso what are the problems with the movie ? \nwell , its main problem is that it\'s simply too jumbled . \nit starts off \" normal \" but then downshifts into this \" fantasy \" world in which you , as an audience member , have no idea what\'s going on . \nthere are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained . \nnow i personally don\'t mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film\'s biggest problem . \nit\'s obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes . \nand do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ? \nnot really . \nthe sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half-way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still didn\'t the make the film all that more entertaining . \ni guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is \" into it \" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding . \ni mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! ! \nokay , we get it . . . there \nare people chasing her and we don\'t know who they are . \ndo we really need to see it over and over again ? \nhow about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ? \napparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows . \nthere might\'ve been a pretty decent teen mind-fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess \" the suits \" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense . \nthe actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood . \nbut my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character\'s unraveling . \noverall , the film doesn\'t stick because it doesn\'t entertain , it\'s confusing , it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it . \noh , and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . . it\'s \njust packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids . \nit also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since . \nwhatever . . . skip \nit ! \nwhere\'s joblo coming from ? \na nightmare of elm street 3 ( 7/10 ) - blair witch 2 ( 7/10 ) - the crow ( 9/10 ) - the crow : salvation ( 4/10 ) - lost highway ( 10/10 ) - memento ( 10/10 ) - the others ( 9/10 ) - stir of echoes ( 8/10 ) \n'
?,'films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they\'re about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there\'s never really been a comic book like from hell before . \nfor starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid \'80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . \nto say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . \nthe book ( or \" graphic novel , \" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . \nin other words , don\'t dismiss this film because of its source . \nif you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell\'s directors , albert and allen hughes . \ngetting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that\'s set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ? \nthe ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london\'s east end . \nit\'s a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called \" unfortunates \" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision . \nwhen the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case . \nabberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . \nupon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn\'t so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can\'t stomach . \ni don\'t think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won\'t go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay . \nin the comic , they don\'t bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end . \nit\'s funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts . \nand from hell\'s ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( \" who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? \" ) . \ndon\'t worry - it\'ll all make sense when you see it . \nnow onto from hell\'s appearance : it\'s certainly dark and bleak enough , and it\'s surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) . \nthe print i saw wasn\'t completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don\'t say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic . \noscar winner martin childs\' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place . \neven the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent . \nians holm ( joe gould\'s secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham . \ni cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually wasn\'t half bad . \nthe film , however , is all good . \n2 : 00 - r for strong violence/gore , sexuality , language and drug content \n'
?,'the happy bastard\'s quick movie review \ndamn that y2k bug . \nit\'s got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother ( william this time ) in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on . \nlittle do they know the power within . . . \ngoing for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there , virus still feels very empty , like a movie going for all flash and no substance . \nwe don\'t know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere , we don\'t know the origin of what took over the ship ( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir ) , and , of course , we don\'t know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout . \nhere , it\'s just \" hey , let\'s chase these people around with some robots \" . \nthe acting is below average , even from the likes of curtis . \nyou\'re more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20 . \nsutherland is wasted and baldwin , well , he\'s acting like a baldwin , of course . \nthe real star here are stan winston\'s robot design , some schnazzy cgi , and the occasional good gore shot , like picking into someone\'s brain . \nso , if robots and body parts really turn you on , here\'s your movie . \notherwise , it\'s pretty much a sunken ship of a movie . \n'
?,'on june 30 , 1960 , a self-taught , idealistic , yet pragmatic , young man became , at age 36 , the first head of government of a newly independent african state , formerly the belgian congo . \ntwo months later , he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides . \nthis little-known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in \" lumumba . \" \npatrice lumumba\'s ( eriq ebouaney ) story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary , \" lumumba - death of a prophet , \" virtually guaranteeing that his new , fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject . \npeck , with co-writer pascal bonitzer , begins at the end of the story of the young political leader . \nwe watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men . \nimages of hatchets , saws and fast-emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image . \njump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian-owned congo . \na third class postal worker , lumumba , speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes , proclaiming himself not tribal , not regional , but a national leader . \nhis small , mobile party , the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer , and get his face known , in the bustling capital , stanleyville . \nat a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world , lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc . \nas the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation\'s first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) . \nthe coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country\'s vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more . \nlumumba won\'t seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government . \nhis initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination . \nthe situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , belgian troops violently intervene , the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad . \nthis tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries . \npeck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba , his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50\'s and 60\'s . \n ( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them . \nsome colonial masters were better than others . ) \nthe effort involved in \" lumumba \" is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all . \nproduction values are first rate on what must be a small , by us standards , budget . \nthe period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique . \nthe screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman\'s work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba\'s life . \nthe political side of things is evenly told in a linear , straightforward manner that teaches , not preaches . \nit concentrates on the good deeds of the man , if a bit as a stalwart saint , but doesn\'t embellish on a larger than life persona . \nthe family side of patrice\'s life is handled in several , perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children , embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child . \ni know the intent is to flesh the man out , but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba . \nthe story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it . \nhigh marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character . \nthe actor gives a convincing , charismatic performance as the multifaceted , politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions . \nin true docudrama tradition , the supporting cast does not outshine the star , complementing his good efforts , instead . \n \" lumumba \" is a solid , interesting , educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos , both . \nit has more intelligence in its telling than anything i\'ve seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b+ . \n'
?,'call it a road trip for the walking wounded . \nstellan skarsg ? rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it\'s difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly , boozed-out presence . \nyet this ever-reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen , a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama . \nplaywright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets , unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late . \nthat\'s an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for , focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father , tomas ( skarsg ? rd ) and his alienated , openly hostile yuppie daughter , kaisa ( lena headey , gossip ) . \nthey haven\'t spoken in years , and wouldn\'t even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen , scotland by automobile if it weren\'t for kaisa\'s mother ( charlotte rampling , under the sand ) rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer . \nin a soap opera twist , mother has only a few days to live . \n ( only in the movies , right ? ) \ntoo blitzed to even step foot on a plane , tomas hits the open road with kaisa . \nloathing each other all the while , they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out -- whenever he isn\'t muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be . \ndespite his sloshed viewpoint , tomas recognizes that the apple hasn\'t fallen very far from the tree . \nkaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke , sabotages her personal relationships through indifference , and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper . \nain\'t they a pair ? \nunable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one-note and repetitively bitchy dialogue , screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward -- lost money , roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around , nosy cops , and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative . \nby the time they reach the hospital , it\'s time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father-daughter conflict , they\'re also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe . \nthis revelation exists purely for its own sake . \naberdeen doesn\'t know where else to go . \nweak , unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa . \nif lena headey were a stronger actress , perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody , haunting cinematography ( rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world -- the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional ) . \nheadey\'s too busy acting , using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance . \nif she were paying any attention to skarsg ? rd , maybe she\'d figure out that doing less can reveal so much more . \nit\'s worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 , jonathan nossiter\'s captivating signs & wonders . \nit\'s not just because skarsg ? rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films ( they\'re not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen ) . \nthe differences in the way their characters were presented is significant . \nin aberdeen , rampling is a luminous diva , preening and static in her hospital bed . \ndespite skarsg ? rd\'s solid performance as tomas , his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow . \nthere\'s genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs & wonders , allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity . \nnossiter\'s film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain . \nif signs & wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas , at least it\'s willing to stretch beyond what we\'ve come to expect from traditional drama . \naberdeen is never half so ambitious , content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies . \nwhen did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life ? \nthe depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdan\'s trite but occasionally useful grand canyon , where steve martin\'s hollywood mogul pronounces , \" all of life\'s riddles are answered in the movies ! \" \neven foreign films are taking that advice to heart . \n'
?,'after bloody clashes and independence won , lumumba refused to pander to the belgians , who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship with the congo . \ntheir officers , particularly general janssens ( rudi delhem ) in the force publique , the congo\'s army , caused rebellions , undermining lumumba , who was outraged at the rape and murder of belgian nationals . \nwith unrest building , moise tshombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and the province of katanga , which contained 70 percent of the country\'s resources , proclaimed secession . \nlumumba replaced janssens , making mobutu a colonel , and went on a pacification \ntour with congolese president joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) , but it was too late . \n\'when you want to drown a dog , you say it has rabies , \' prophesies lumumba of his own fate . \npeck and bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a myriad of players , although they frequently succumb to cliche , particularly regarding lumumba\'s private life . \npeck\'s script illuminates bantu sayings like \'the hand that gives , rules\' when lumumba uses it with the american ambassador . \npeck\'s direction is less assured , with many scenes unfortunately playing like standard television fare . \nhe\'s served well , though , by his casting of ebouaney in the title role . \nebouaney is dynamic , radiating his character\'s fierce passion for his people and his country . \nlumumba\'s intelligence and ability to strategize , even as he\'s cornered by insurmountable odds , are given life by ebouaney . \npeck\'s subject and lead actor elevate his film above its mediocre production . \n \" lumumba \" is a story that deserves to be told and ebouaney\'s performance makes the tragedy personally felt . \n'
?,'the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire-fu copycats . \nit\'s not a pretty death , and it\'s leaving the likes of schwartznager , stallone , and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea . \nsometimes , the mix results in a mind-blowing spectacle unlike any other . \nquality action with amazing and exciting stunt work , as in 1999\'s the matrix , can be a real gem . \nbut too often hollywood gets it wrong , even when they pay off chinese directors . \nflying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists . \nmostly it\'s laughable . \nin hollywood\'s rush to emulate the success of the matrix , trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form . \nbut iron monkey , the latest asian import , shows us how to get it right . \niron monkey ( actually a reissue of a 1993 film ) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante ( rongguang yu ) , fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry . \nbut it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei-hong , most recently seen in one of the most overlooked , and possibly best films of 2000 , drunken master 2 ( released in the u . s . as the legend of drunken master ) . \nunlike drunken master 2 , which stars jackie chan as an adult fei-hong , iron monkey finds a much younger fei-hong ( sze-man tsang ) and his father wong kei-ying ( yen chi dan ) thrust into the middle of iron monkey\'s fight against oppression . \niron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2 . at times , fighting styles , especially that of monkey himself , do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle-toed floating of films like crouching tiger , hidden dragon , director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth . \niron monkey is at its heart a hardcore , kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger . \nhowever , there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters , such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good-hearted but misguided enemy , chief fox . \nin those moments , and in others , iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience . \nwhile in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2 , iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune . \naka siunin wong fei-hung tsi titmalau . \n'
?,'best remembered for his understated performance as dr . hannibal lecter in michael mann\'s forensics thriller , manhunter , scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on . \nusually playing a bit role in some studio schlock ( he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight ) , he\'s only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do . \nif you want to see some brilliant acting , check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach\'s hidden agenda . \ncox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l . i . e . , which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge . \nbig john feels the love that dares not speak its name , but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad . \nwhat bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light . \nhe\'s an even-tempered , funny , robust old man who actually listens to the kids\' problems ( as opposed to their parents and friends , both caught up in the high-wire act of their own confused lives . ) \nhe\'ll have sex-for-pay with them only after an elaborate courtship , charming them with temptations from the grown-up world . \nl . i . e . stands for long island expressway , which slices through the strip malls and middle-class homes of suburbia . \nfilmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a ( pretty transparent ) metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15-year old protagonist , howie ( paul franklin dano ) . \nin his opening voice-over , howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road , citing the l . i . e . \nhighway deaths of filmmaker alan j . pakula , songwriter harry chapin , and his own mother on exit 52 . \nhe\'s both fascinated and disturbed by the l . i . e . , and those feelings are projected onto big john ( who follows howie around in his bright red car , but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesn\'t want to do . \nthis makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies -- he\'s a beast , but ashamed of it . ) \nl . i . e . would have worked best as a half-hour short film about howie\'s ill-advised foray into big john\'s haven . \nthere is unnecessary padding with howie\'s miserable dad ( bruce altman ) in the hot seat for a white-collar crime , degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle-class houses , and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise-ass gary terrio ( billy kay ) , a handsome artful dodger . \nrather than add to the themes of suburban ennui ( not that we needed another movie on that subject ) , these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length . \nconcurrently , the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted . \ncox , sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo , is all bluff and bluster . \ndano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent . \nwe\'re so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious ( calling haley joel ! ) , it\'s surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene . \nthe restraint is admirable . \nbut l . i . e . \'s screenplay doesn\'t always give them the best material . \nwhen howie reads big john a walt whitman poem , the moment feels a bit too precious . \ndirector michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john , who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach\'s goldberg variations . \nit\'s too much . \nthere are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john\'s other boy toy ( walter masterson ) , jealous over the newbie . \nthis plot thread predictably leads to violence . \nnot content to be a haunting , observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world ( like terry zwigoff\'s superb ghost world ) , cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note . \nit\'s typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet , sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex , philosophical note . \nin this regard , l . i . e . \n ( and countless other indie films ) share something in common with blockbuster action films : problems are solved when the obstacle is removed . \nhow often does real life work this way ? \nto extend the question : if a movie is striving for realism , do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion ? \n'
?,'after watching \" rat race \" last week , i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that , when not laughing aloud , i had held a grin for virtually all of the film\'s 112 minutes . \nsaturday night , i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didn\'t enjoy it as much the second time as the first . \n \" rat race \" is a great goofy delight , a dandy mix of energetic performances , inspired sight gags and flat-out silliness . \nhands down , this is the most fun film of the summer . \nthe movie begins with zippy retro-style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a \'60s slapstick comedy , featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky-jerky bodies bounding around the screen . \nthen comes the setup . \ndonald sinclair ( john cleese ) , the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas , enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients . \nto that end , he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines . \ngathering together the lucky token holders , he explains , \" today you have a chance to play a game where the odds of winning are one in six . \" \nthe competition is simple : each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city , n . m . , containing $2 million in cash . \nthere is a transmitter in every key , so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead . \nthe race has no rules ? whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money . \nsince it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes , let\'s use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers . \ndecked out in flashy , trashy clothing and sporting big hair , vera baker ( whoopi goldberg ) is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby . \nshe finds that grown-up merrill ( lanai chapman ) is erudite , conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life . \nthrown together , it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature . \nowen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) is currently the most hated man in america . \nan nfl referee , he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a high-profile game . \nafter escaping from a vengeful cab driver , owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention . \nmr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) is a cheerful , odd little italian man on holiday in america . \nhe also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most inopportune times . \npollini hitches a ride with zack ( wayne knight ) , a hyper-tense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation . \nrandy pear ( jon lovitz ) promised his wife beverly ( kathy najimy ) and two kids a fun-filled vacation in las vegas . \nfearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race , he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview . \nbeverly insists the family stay together , so they hop in the mini-van and tear off into the desert . \nbrothers duane ( seth green ) and blaine ( vince vieluf ) cody are young , crooked and stupid . \nblaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly self-done tongue piercing , and duane is the only person who can come close to understanding him . \nthe boys will stop at nothing to reach their goal . \nfinally , nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) is a no-nonsense lawyer-in-training who recruits helicopter pilot tracy faucet ( amy smart ) for the journey . \nat first glance , they seem blandly wholesome , but all that changes when tracy buzzes the home of her boyfriend shawn ( dean cain ) and spies him swimming with another woman . \ndirector jerry zucker ( \" airplane , \" \" ghost \" ) leaps from racer to racer , periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair and mr . grisham ( dave thomas ) , his personality-impaired right hand man , continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers . \nas with any zucker production , a few jokes fall flat , but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps . \nhigh points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally , with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay-off . \nhad i been part of the filmmaking team , i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby\'s clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron . \nit would have drawn the same laugh without the squirm-inducing hint of child molestation . \ni also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence . \nmy god , do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing \" all star ? \" \nbut enough carping . \n \" rat race \" is a riot , with terrific no-holds-barred performances from the diverse cast . \nsee it , see it again and when the dvd comes out , buy it , because a movie this hilarious will surely have outtakes to die for . \n'
?,'i\'m really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone . \nsure , she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god\'s green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy ) , but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in , she always strikes out . \nthe crush was a slow-moving , predictable piece of fluff . \nhideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in . \nclueless was an annoying , unfunny waste of time . \nand people have e-mailed me too , saying clueless is a good movie and that i\'m the only one who doesn\'t like it . \none girl said if i\'d seen the movie with \" an open mind , \" i would have enjoyed it . \nnothing could be further from the truth . \ni went into the theater expecting to love the movie . \nthe preview looked good and of course i\'m crazymadinlove with alicia , but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny , unlikable characters . \nalmost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way . \nwhen we were walking out of the theater , one guy ( and it wasn\'t me ) yelled out , \" that was the worst f$&#in\' movie i\'ve ever seen \" and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement . \nso last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia\'s pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called the babysitter . \ni knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i\'ll probably never understand made me rent it anyway . \nwhat i got was 90 minutes of regret--the worst alicia silverstone movie ever . \nand you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like . \nwhere to begin in criticizing this movie ? \nthe plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier , the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old , alicia is the star and she\'s still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever . \nthere is zero humor , zero suspense , zero drama and zero action , until the last ten minutes , when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence . \nzero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero . \nso why does this movie get one star out of me ? \nwell , alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub . \nand if it wasn\'t bubble bath , the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four- star features , but you settle for what you can get . \nalicia plays a babysitter who\'s spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party . \nand of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home ( at least that movie critic at large guy does ) . \nas the movie trods along , we discover she\'s not only the mostly-silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character\'s fantasies ( and probably every male viewer\'s too ) . \nthe drunken father thinks she\'s just the thing to recapture his lost youth , her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside , even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she\'s taking her bubble bath . \nthey even throw in the middle aged wife\'s fantasies about a male counterpart at the party . \nnot that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy . \nat least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg-rated . \nin fact , i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late-night staple if not for the fact that there\'s absolutely no nudity in it . \nso you can\'t call it a sex flick . \ni\'ve already pointed out that it can\'t fall under drama , comedy , thriller or action , so what do you classify the babysitter as ? \nbad . \n'
?,'carry on matron is the last great carry-on film in my opinion . \nmade in 1972 , it still features most of the regulars of this genre . \nsid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit , kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting , head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac , hattie jacques re-takes her role as matron , and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr . goode . \nthe jokes come in fast and so do the laughs , with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard . \nthis time , williams is after matron ( jacques ) when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr . goode . \nthe doctor ( hawtrey ) is sworn to secrecy : - \" i assure you , that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other ! \" \nbernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself . \nthere are great cameos from joan sims , an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene , and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he\'s at work ( at the railway station ) . \nsid james\' gang including cyril his son ( kenneth cope ) try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home . \nhe has to share a room with nurse ball ( barbara windsor ) and she soon sees through him ! \nthe film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospital\'s pills with panic ensuing . \nthere are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron , however her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous \'matron\'s\' . \nwilliams is , as usual , on top form , but sid james isn\'t given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all . \nthe same does not go for charles hawtrey , for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone and has scarce screen time , he seems to steal every scene he is in . \nby not making use of sid james and barbara windsor\'s talent to full effect , the film seems to flounder , but it certainly makes up for it with it\'s good storyline and it\'s other appealing characters . \nthis film is genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored ! \n'
?,'having not seen , \" who framed roger rabbit \" in over 10 years , and not remembering much besides that i liked it then , i decided to rent it recently . \nwatching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is . \naside from the fact that it\'s a milestone in animation in movies ( it\'s the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters , have them interact , and make it convincingly real ) and a great entertainment it\'s also quite an effective comedy/mystery . \nwhile the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original , especially baby herman , and watching them together is a lot of fun . \nthe story begins in hollywood in 1947 . \ncartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work , so hard-boiled private detective eddie valiant ( bob hoskins ) is called in by studio head r . k . \nmaroon ( alan tilvern ) to try to help get roger\'s mind back on work . \nmaroon thinks that roger\'s wife , jessica\'s , possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots . \nvaliant takes some photos of jessica playing , `patty cake\' with marvin acme ( stubby kaye ) , the owner of toontown ( where all of the cartoon characters live ) and takes them to maroon . \nupon seeing them , roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect . \nthe rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town ( and eventually toontown ) trying to clear roger\'s good name . \nalong the way they meet judge doom ( christopher lloyd ) a judge-jury-and executioner type who\'s out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a `toon . \' \n`who framed roger rabbit\' won 4 academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters ( williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in ) . \ndirector robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production , which included hundreds of animators . \nalso bob hoskins\' performance should be credited . \nhe , in addition to the rest of the human cast , finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co-stars . \naccording to the internet movie database , hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off . \n`who framed roger rabbit\' is a rare film . \none that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family ( although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom ) . \ndo yourself a favor and rent it , `p-p-p-p-please . \" \n'
?,'there\'s something about ben stiller that makes him a popular choice among casting directors these days . \nstiller currently has three projects in circulation , and what other actor can lay claim to that ? \nhe\'s in \" there\'s something about mary , \" which i * still * haven\'t seen . \nand he\'s in the acerbic \" your friends & neighbors , \" playing a talkative , sexually-frustrated drama coach called jerri . \nnow there\'s \" permanent midnight , \" in which stiller plays another jerry , this one a heroin-addicted television writer , last name stahl . \nthere\'s also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drug-addiction pictures the minute they\'ve proved themselves commercially . \newan mcgregor springs to mind who , after successful turns in \" emma \" and \" brassed off , \" received greater respect and admiration for his mind-blowing realization as renton in danny boyle\'s transatlantic junk-fest , \" trainspotting . \" \nthe philosophy appears to be a simple one : if you want \'em to be taken seriously , make \'em do drugs . \n \" permanent midnight \" is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl , a successful hollywood writer who , in the mid-eighties , had a $5 , 000-a-week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a $6 , 000-a-week heroin habit . \na habit , in stahl\'s own words , \" the size of utah . \" \nas stahl , stiller contributes a commanding performance . \nunlike \" trainspotting , \" which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse , \" permanent midnight \" instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance . \none of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to \" naked lunch \" author william s . burroughs who , when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds , \" so i can shave . \" \nstahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in \" permanent midnight \" ; it\'s so he can talk to his mother on the phone , show up for work on time , even pay his bills . \nwhile the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl , the writing ( adapted from stahl\'s autobiography by director david veloz ) is controlled and pointed . \n \" permanent midnight \" shows how stahl moved from new york to l . a . to--again in the author\'s words-- \" escape the drug scene \" ( yeah , right ) ; why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec ( elizabeth hurley , so impossibly polite you\'d swear her single profanity was dubbed ) ; and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings . \nstahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty ( norristown\'s own maria bello ) with whom he spent some rehab time . \njaneane garofalo is wasted--and miscast--as a heavily-bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the doped-up wordsmith , and that\'s stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor . \nstiller , unshaven ( burroughs take note ) and with lots of mascara around the eyes , has stahl stumble through the film looking like a train wreck but , to his credit , never once pushes his pill-popping , needle-jabbing performance over the top . \nthe ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see \" permanent midnight \" ; a dark , comic , and strangely absorbing study of assisted living . \n'
?,' \" knock off \" is exactly that : a cheap knock off of an action movie . \nit\'s also the worst movie i have seen thus far this year . \ni figured it would be at least a couple of months before i saw the worst film of 1998 , but alas , it has already been found . \njean-claude van damme stars as ( i think ) a designer jeans executive who discovers his half-brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods . \nrob schneider plays van damme\'s partner , and rochon plays . . . \nactually , i have no idea who rochon was supposed to be . \nshe just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there . \nmany things are not explained in this film , but i do know that for some bizarre reason , van damme seemed to be doing a jackie chan impression throughout the flick . \nwhere chan comes off as endearing in his \" normal guy \" character seen in many of his films , van damme just comes off as a wimp . \nwe\'re never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions . \nto be more clear : i did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie , and even then , it was not made too clear . \nthe film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong . \ntsui hark ( who directed van damme\'s last movie , the bad , but not nearly as bad as this , \" double team \" ) never lets the camera rest for a second , and that\'s no exaggeration . \nwe are even treated to a five second shot from the point of view of van damme\'s foot entering a shoe . \nfabulous ! \nseriously , though , i have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions , as long as they don\'t get carried away . \nfor example , look at sam raimi . \n \" army of darkness \" , one of his best movies , features some of the most inventive camera work i have ever seen , but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story . \nthat\'s a concept that tsui can\'t seem to grasp . \nthe special effects and outrageous camera angles * rule * \" knock off \" to the point where the audience doesn\'t have a clue as to what\'s happening any more . \nanother problem with the film is that it looks cheap . \nthe film stock used is of such low caliber that i thought i was watching one of those chinese films shown really late at night . \nand for some inexplicable reason , everyone\'s voice seems to have been dubbed . \neven the stars . \nand even the special effects , seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about , are inconsistent . \nfor example , there is a scene in which van damme drives a car out of a window . \nthe car slams into the ground , and the left wheel is completely destroyed . \nseconds later , the car drives off at full speed . \nhey , i have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie , but a line must be drawn somewhere . \nfinally , the acting . \nnobody gives a good performance in this film . \nvan damme , an actor i usually like , is way off the mark playing \" everyman \" . \nand schneider , here to provide comic relief i assume , is totally unfunny and over acts his way through every scene . \neven the usually solid paul sorvino gives a terribly over-the-top performance as . . . \nonce again , i have no idea who he was supposed to be . \nin case i haven\'t yet made it clear enough , \" knock off \" is the worst movie of van damme\'s career and possibly the worst movie of the decade . \nand it\'s not even one of those movies that\'s so bad it\'s funny . \nit\'s too inept to be funny . \nthere are no redeeming factors in \" knock off \" and i seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to a crisp and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased . \n'
?,'call 911 for the cliche police if you must , but the eyes are the window to the soul . \nthe finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze : paul newman , ralph fiennes , anthony hopkins , morgan freeman . \nyou look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds , that the characters they play are real human beings . \nwe will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor , but he had that unique quality in his eyes . \nin gridlock\'d , an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire , shakur and his co-star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry . \nshakur and roth play ezekiel \" spoon \" whitmore and alexander \" stretch \" rome , two detroit buddies who share a spoken word/jazz trio , an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie ( thandie newton ) . \nwhen a new year\'s eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose , spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time . \nthey soon make a new year\'s resolution to get into rehab , but that proves to be easier said than done . \nas though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough , spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy , confusion and red tape . \nthe government might be the least of their obstacles , however , as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer , and on the run from a nasty thug ( vondie curtis hall ) . \nin order for you to buy into gridlock\'d at all , you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism ; unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie , they are going to government offices on new year\'s day , in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all . \ngridlock\'d may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey , 1991\'s falling down , which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles . \nin falling down , michael douglas\' d-fens ( the character\'s personalized license plate , echoed in gridlock\'d by the drug lord d-reper\'s plates ) whips out a gun because he can\'t get breakfast at mcdonald\'s ; in gridlock\'d , spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center . \nand where the unhinged d-fens became a heroic surrogate for audiences , writer/director vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation . \none bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question , \" do you expect the world to stop . . . just \nbecause you picked _today_ to clean up ? \" \nthe world in gridlock\'d is just as frustrating as the world in falling down , but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time . \nhall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system , but perhaps not enough of them . \na significant chunk of gridlock\'d is devoted to spoon and stretch\'s flight from d-reper and from the police , and those sub-plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments . \nin one scene , stretch scares off d-reper by getting chummy with a police officer ; another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly-suspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures . \nthe entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running , while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time . \nhall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film\'s main events , perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self-destructive behavior . \noh , the irony of it . \ntupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case , and living the life to back it up . \nin gridlock\'d , shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him . \nspoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall , but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction . \nmostly it comes through those eyes , eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta . \nit is spoon who plays conscience to stretch\'s pure appetite , and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self-destructiveness ( he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again ) which is as much an obstacle to spoon\'s goal as any agency or enemy . \ngridlock\'d\'s most cruelly comic scene finds stretch \" helping \" spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife , and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him . \nwith friends like that , spoon doesn\'t need enemies , and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much . \nthe tragedy now is that we won\'t get more chances to see those eyes again . \n'
?,'you\'ve heard all the hype . \nyou\'ve seen all their faces - natalie portman ( the professional ) as queen amidala , liam neeson ( schindler\'s list ) as qui-gon jinn , ewan mcgregor ( trainspotting ) as obi-wan kenobi , and jake lloyd ( jingle all the way ) as young anakin skywalker . \nif you\'ve read any reviews , you\'ve also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy . \nyou also may have heard that this one\'s too kiddie-friendly , and doesn\'t have enough content for adults . \nbelieve the hype . \nthe effects are stunning , the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic , the lightsaber duels are amazing , and queen amidala\'s sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth . \nbut there\'s something missing here , and it isn\'t budget or effects - it\'s everything money * can\'t * buy . \nthe actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad-stroked and flat characters . \nthe most successful at this is liam neeson who , as qui-gon jinn , a jedi master to young obi-wan kenobi , has quiet dignity and a wise , commanding presence . \nhe is the anchor to this movie , as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out . \nportman\'s queen amidala and mcgregor\'s obi-wan kenobi don\'t fare nearly so well . \namidala , the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) . \nand obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he\'s nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn\'s batman . \nhowever , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job . \nhe also absolutely nails alec guiness\' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise . \nin fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that\'s one of the problems with this film . \ni would never call myself a \" star wars \" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i\'ve always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america . \nhowever , if you are the one person in america who * hasn\'t * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn\'t bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost . \nfor example , one of the film\'s main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine . \nfor those of you not recently steeped in \" star wars \" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader\'s master in \" return of the jedi \" and \" empire strikes back . \" \nso , obviously , his appearance in \" phantom menace \" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful . \na lot of the movie is like that . \nr2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it\'s obvious that lucas is banking on the audience\'s pre-existing fondness for them . . . \nbecause he doesn\'t do much to add to it in any way . \nsame goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn\'t look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy . \neven * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from \" empire strikes back \" ) , and alderaan ( leia\'s home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in \" star wars \" ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing . \nwhat\'s the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ? \nthe answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty . \nthere\'s no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be . \nanother problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film . \ni was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters . \nand jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast . \nunlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you\'ll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive \" teenage mutant ninja turtles . \" \nfurthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot . \noddly , this isn\'t just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids . \nwell , he\'s done a good job . \nthe hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy . \nthat\'s not jake lloyd\'s fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him . \nthat\'s another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader . \nwarning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! \nin my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin\'s future evil in the film . \nthe boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there\'s nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie . \nhe has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine . \nbut the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn\'t all hearts and roses is yoda\'s hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn . \nhis explanation ? \n \" his future is clouded . \" \n ( warning : major spoiler ahead . \nenter at your own risk . ) \nof course , the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary-looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side . \nthis dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double-sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup . \nbecause qui-gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi-wan , qui-gon\'s young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself . \nso , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi-wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin \" darth vader \" skywalker . \ndid this story need to be told ? \ni would say no . \nbut is it a worthwhile movie to see ? \nabsolutely . \nif you don\'t enter the theater with jedi-size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , then this is your movie . \nthe tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation . \nthe digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight . \nand yoda and young obi-wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time . \nabove all , this is a fun movie . \nnot deep , not meaningful , and not profound . \nbut fun . \nmaybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co-write the script , and the guy who directed \" empire \" will direct . \nbecause if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential . \n : ) \n'

romeo must die\'s couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another . \ntheir romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history . \nthe performances are adequate if not fully acceptable . \nli , of course has the showiest part , having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination . \nallayah , in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace . \nit\'s obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic . \nbut , still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it . \ndelro lindo as issac o\'day carries himself well in the film . \nan unsung and under appreciated actor , mr . lindo turns out the films best performance . \nthe other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d . b . woodside as issac\'s son , colin . \nthe performance is undirected , with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in . \nan unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written . \nfirst time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film . \nhaving a career as one of the industry\'s best cinematographers , bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots , and \" romeo must die \" does look good . \nbut the pacing of the film is lethargic , only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes . \nthe script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in . \nthe big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing . \nand of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah\'s bodyguard , maurice has no comic timing whatsoever . \nthe best things about the film are its fight scenes . \njet li is a master of these intricate physical battles . \none needs only to see his film \" fist of legend \" to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat . \nhere , jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that \" lethal weapon 4 \" ( jet\'s u . s . debut ) didn\'t allow . \nunfortunately , a lot of jet\'s fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision . \nalso \" romeo must die \" must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film , and that is an x-ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film , showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent . \nobviously a homage to the famed x-ray scene from sonny chiba\'s \" streetfighter \" , the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film . \nit\'s as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted . \none problem though about the fight scenes . \nthose that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon . \nthey do have an internal rhythm to them . \na heartbeat , so to speak in their choreography . \nthe fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance . \nthis is created by the performance , the direction and the editing . \nhere in \" romeo must die \" , there is no staccato . \nevery fight scene , even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern . \nthe rhythm is monotonous . \na hong kong film has a tempo that changes , heightening its emotional impact . \n\'rmd\' is limited to a standard 4/4 tempo , not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever . \na fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan\'s films . . \nwatch the restaurant fight from the film \" rush hour \" and notice that the context of the fight , while technically amazing is rather flat ( the framing and cut always do not help ) . \nnow look at the warehouse fight from \" rumble in the bronx \" . \nthere you have a heartbeat , and emotional draw that doesn\'t let the audience catch its breath . \nthe stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly , causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted . \nhere in \'romeo must die\' , the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl . \njet li is a grand and personable screen presence . \nit\'s a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here . \none day filmmakers here in the u . s . will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity . \nuntil then , we\'ll be left with emotionally hollow product like \" the replacement killer \" and , currently \" romeo

?,'dora ( fernanda montenegro ) sits behind a make-shift desk at rio+s major train station . \nshe , in her colorful demeanor , offers a service that is unheard of in the states . \nshe writes letters for the illiterate , who pass through , to try to find lost relatives , find love , or search after lost debts . \nshe+s quirky , she+s elderly , she+s caring . \ntotally trustworthy , right ? \nnot a chance . \nonce home , she never sends these letters , saving money on postage , and relishing in the drama contained therein with her neighbor irene ( mar ? lia p ? ra ) . \none of the letters is sent by a young mother with her nine-year old son , looking for their father . \nshortly thereafter , she gets hit by a bus , and the son is orphaned . \ndays go by , and the boy , named josu ? , roams around the station , hungry , desperate , and somewhat clueless to his predictament . \nthrough a series of circumstances too precious to elaborate upon , dora somehow takes a responsibility in trying to find josu ? +s father . \nthis means leaving the security of rio , traveling to the outskirts of brazil , where unpaved roads , religious devotees and the poverty-stricken become commonplace . \nfilms like this remind me as to what i enjoy about some foreign films . \nit is an opportunity for me to get a fresh breath in another part of the world , so distant from my own . \nit does so entertainingly , and so heart-wrenchingly . \nand yet , it+s backdrop is merely that . \nthe focus is on the minute transformation of dora , of how she learns to love this little kid , without being cloying or sentimental . \nthe most interesting backdrop is the amount of religious dedication is in the film . \ndora being an amoral scam-artist , could care less about the amount of bickering between the candle-lighting of the catholics versus the bumper-sticker mentality of the evangelicals . \nbut neither side is trivialized . \nshe even begins to develop an affection for a non-drinking evangelical , who sees the problems with dora , if not initially . \nfernanda montenegro surprisingly got an oscar nomination for this very delicate performance , but the true marvel is that of vinicius de oliveira , who plays josu ? . \nhe , like the discoveries of j ? r ? mie renier ( _la promesse_ ) and giorgio cantarini ( _life is beautiful_ ) , prove that the true acting discoveries may be outside of the united states . \nhe is a natural , and never once grating . \nsend a memo to jonathan taylor thomas . \n'
?,'among multitude of erotic thrillers , that had been released in the early 1990s , woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed by robert ginty , star of the b-grade action films of the previous decade . \nthose who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star . \nas director , ginty did very little to improve that impression . \nthe protagonist of the movie is jack ( played by jeff fahey ) , yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford ( played by bo derek ) . \nhowever , she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby ( steven bauer ) . \none stormy night , the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder . \nhowever , his good friend walter j . hill ( robert mitchum ) happens to be very good lawyer , so jack might even prove his innocence in the end . \nbelonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller , woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots . \nunfortunately , this film isn\'t comedy and any laugh is unintentional . \nthe characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them . \nthe actors that play them don\'t help either . \nthat is especially the case with jeff fahey , whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison . \nhis partner bo derek , on the other hand , shows that she didn\'t age enough to cease being the sex goddess , but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents . \nginty , on the other hand , tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting , but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer . \n'
?,'out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey , a cold , uninvolving , confusing new thriller . \nthough the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard ( author of out of sight , as well as jackie brown , get shorty and pulp fiction ) , after you watch it , you realize that it\'s not nearly good enough . \nin an aggressively non-linear fashion , the limey ( li * mey , noun : an english gentleman ) tells the story of wilson ( terrence stamp ) , a british ex-con just released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed robbery . \nhe has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny . \nhe doesn\'t know much about the circumstances of her demise , all he has is a name : terry valentine . \nvalentine was jenny\'s former boyfriend , a wealthy and corrupt record executive . \nhe\'s played by peter fonda , in his first major role since the terrific ulee\'s gold in 1997 . \nseeking valentine\'s reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson . \nhe finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party . \nhe winds up breaking his cover eventually , setting off valentine\'s head of security and valentine himself , who decides to run for it . \nwhat a mess . \ni have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time -- pulp fiction , which twisted time every which way , was a masterpiece -- but i do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer . \nthe limey does exactly that . \nthe plot is permeated with flashbacks , flash-forwards and what can only be described as random time-travel , without any evident purpose . \nthere is no method to this movie\'s madness . \nit uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably . \nthe plot isn\'t particularly interesting in the first place : traditional , mildly hackneyed and not very involving . \nthis is a sort of brooding film -- our protagonist doesn\'t speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude . \ni felt like the director wasn\'t very interested in the proceedings himself , almost like he made this film for a paycheck . \nditto for the editing , which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant . \nsixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal . \nhe\'s not much in the way of stature but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here . \npeter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor : he\'s shy , quiet but always effective . \nhe\'s adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression : his feelings don\'t always show on his face by you can always tell what they are . \nthis is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion . \nwhy soderbergh couldn\'t just parrot down and tell a story , i don\'t know , but what he does do certainly doesn\'t work . \nthe result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil -- even the action scenes don\'t work . \n1999 may have signified the death of the traditional act one - act two - act three storyline , but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it . \nshall we go back to basics ? \n'
?,'will hunting ( matt damon ) is a natural genius . \nfor a movie character , that\'s usually a death sentence . \nit\'s a trait associated with what my brother calls \" too good for this world \" movies , like phenomenon or powder . \nforgive me for spoiling the ending , but will doesn\'t die . \nthis is no formula movie . \nin fact , it\'s quite fresh and original . \nit\'s a character study more than anything , and that\'s not surprising , considering it was written by two actors : damon and co-star ben affleck . \nwill works whatever kind of job he can get . \nfirst he\'s a janitor , then he works construction . \noff-screen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him . \non-screen he hangs out with his friends , picking fights in robust , romanticized-hemingway fashion . \nlambeau ( stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves ) , a math professor , learns that the janitor ( will ) is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics . \nhaving confirmed he\'s not a fluke or a savant , he does what he can to get will into the education system . \nhe is firmly rejected . \nfinally , will lands in jail for one of his fights . \nlambeau can get him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions and to discussing mathematics with him . \nwill ( barely ) decides to go for the therapy over prison . \nlambeau treats will like a son . \nhe\'s proud of , and amazed by , will\'s accomplishments in mathematics . \nhe encourages will and tries to give him structure , knowing that , with a little discipline , he could be bigger than einstein . \nwill isn\'t really interested in academia . \nhe knows he would be the best in his field , and therefore spend all of his time in an office , explaining math to people like lambeau . \nhe would rather work construction , which breaks lambeau\'s heart . \nmeanwhile , will attends his mandated therapy sessions . \nit\'s not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeau\'s \" a \" list . \nwill has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade , and how to keep them from affecting him . \nshrink after shrink refuses to return after will\'s mockery . \nlambeau\'s last hope is his old college roommate , now a psychology teacher at a small-time community college . \nknowing that will is going to try to shred him too , sean ( robin williams ) agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein . \ntrue to form , will finds sean\'s emotional weakness and attacks . \nbut unlike the other shrinks , sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions . \nlike a foster mother with a fussy child , sean knows that the attacks are defensive and is able to take them in stride . \nlike the foster mother , sean knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach . \nrobin williams is excellent in this role . \nhe\'s not an actor with a great range , but in the right roles he has great depth . \nin this movie , as in awakenings , there comes a point when the quiet , shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance , and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes . \nwilliams is the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling . \ni have compared will to a foster child and that\'s not entirely fair . \nemotionally , he has a lot to learn , but he is not a child . \nhe has thought about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants . \nsean , his girlfriend , his pals , and lambeau all help him grow , but he didn\'t start out asking for , or particularly needing , help . \nhis exceptional gift singled him out , and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction . \nif i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama and melodrama . \nit\'s too sentimental and uplifiting for a straight drama , but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama . \nit is emotionally engaging , but it\'s not quite larger than life . \nthis isn\'t a problem per se , but at times i didn\'t know quite how to take it . \nbut this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movie . \na good movie allows its characters to learn and grow . \nit doesn\'t just happen ; it takes a good script , good acting , and good direction . \ngood will hunting has all three . \nif you are at all inclined to see it , by all means , go . \n'

?,'`we run tings . \ntings don\'t run we . \' \n-sound advice from capone ( paul campbell ) to his squaddie ( or partner ) , floyd ( winston bell ) . \njamaican film , shot entirely on video , featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo-styled brotherhood morals ( and a little gunplay ) . \ncapone , a tough as nails super cop , gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home ( while he was with his lady ) and killed his partner in front of him . \nwhen he arrives , he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse , thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie ( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw ) , so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook ) . \ncapone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and , much to his disappointment , also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him . \ntorn between doing his job and protecting his best friend , capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again . \ndirected deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne ( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct ) , one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while . \nshots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films , although the action isn\'t as hyperkinetic as most of woo\'s films are . \nthe action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though , and eventually begin to take on a life of their own ( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after ) . \nthe make-up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well , with flawless squib work on display from the effects team . \nthe cast is superb and listening to their dialogue , spoken with thick jamaican accents ( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang ) , just adds to the interest . \npaul campbell , as the `loose cannon\' capone , essays his role perfectly , displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times . \nmark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty , the part-time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together . \nunfortunately , carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective ( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him ) , but then again , that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed . \nthe music in the film is composed of all reggae songs , and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists , sly and robbie ( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones , maxi priest , bob dylan , james brown , grace jones , herbie hancock , bootsy collins , and carly simon among others ) . \nthe end credit song , `we run tings\' , by the group red dragon , is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review . \noddly enough , desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta\' reggae as the performer ninjaman , and he doesn\'t contribute a single song to the film ( that i could see ) , which is virtually unheard of here in the us . \nat the time of this writing , third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us , coming off of a six-month box-office breaking run in jamaica , where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time ( bringing in $21 million in jamaica , which is roughly $500 , 000 us ) . \npalm pictures ( the company that released the offbeat , but entertaining six-string samurai ) is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market , i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters . \nchris blackwell , founder of palm pictures , was also involved in the production of another jamaican box-office smash in 1981 entitled countryman , so i\'d say he has a pretty good track record . \noverall , third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo , ringo lam , tsui hark , and many other action films by directors from hong kong . \nif action films are your thing and you don\'t mind intermittent subtitles , then you can\'t go wrong with this film . \nthe performances and the story are solid ( if only a little cliched ) and the action is tight . \ni\'m not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like , but apparently third world cop\'s honors are well deserved . \n'

?,'all through its production and into the early days of its initial , aborted pre-release publicity , hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood . \nultimately , however , paramount pictures , nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996\'s other , underperforming disaster films ( dante\'s peak , volcano ) , changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year . \nbut , to paraphrase the bard , swill , by any other name , would smell as rank . \nno number of name changes can help this picture . \nit\'s not just about a disaster , it is a disaster . \nhard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute . \nthe best shot occurs during the opening credits , as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg , indiana as the water level slowly rises . \nthe community , protected by an overworked dam , is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud-choked skies . \nfrom that moment on , it\'s all downhill . \nwhatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point . \nit takes forever to get to the end credits -- this is one of the longest-seeming 95-minute motion pictures i have recently endured . \nbasically , hard rain is one extended , dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot-outs . \nthere\'s a lot of water , broken glass , gunfire , and explosions . \nit\'s all very routine and uninteresting because there aren\'t any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense . \nthe film\'s conclusion is so preposterous that it\'s almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around . \naction films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion . \ngraham yost , the writer of both speed and hard rain , surely understands that principle . \nunfortunately , neither he , nor cinematographer-turned-director mikael salomon ( a far off place ) , applies it . \nthe action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition . \nwe see the same kinds of things -- speedboat chases , flood damage , shoot-outs , etc . -- over and over again . \nthe movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length . \nthe storyline gives us a number of paper-thin characters in contrived circumstances . \nthere\'s tom ( christian slater ) , the one- dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash . \nhe and his partner , charlie ( edward asner , tv\'s \" lou grant \" ) , get stuck on a street that\'s rapidly turning into a river . \na group of men , led by jimmy ( morgan freeman ) , arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers . \nafter charlie is killed in a shoot-out , tom hides the money , then runs . \nas he swims and boats his way through huntingburg\'s roads , he encounters some of the locals : karen ( minnie driver ) , a would-be love interest ; a bickering old couple ( richard dysart and betty white ) , who are on hand to provide comic relief ; and the easily-corrupted sheriff ( randy quaid ) , whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives . \nthere isn\'t any real acting in this film . \nchristian slater utters a few lame one-liners and does a lot of mugging for the camera . \ntom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen . \nrandy quaid sneers a lot , and is totally unconvincing . \nmorgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances , but they are defeated by the script . \nfreeman , one of the best cinematic thespians working today , looks suitably embarrassed to be here , but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time-to-time . \nfollowing in the wake of twister , this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesn\'t trust nature\'s fury as the chief engine of conflict . \nas a result , we are saddled with an idiotic good guys/bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had . \ntitanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water . \nhard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible . \nthus far this year , hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire ( firestorm ) and water ( hard rain ) . \nfortunately , there are only two elements left . \n'

?,'my giant is two movies for the price of one , but neither is worth the cost of admission , even if you get in free . \nas lamely directed by michael lehmann , the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book . \n ( \" without goliath , david is just some punk throwing rocks . \" ) \nlanguidly paced throughout , the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer ( the omen ) meanders toward its sad ending . \nsince it\'s rarely funny or convincingly dramatic , what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery . \nother than a few nice visuals , there\'s nothing to recommend the picture . \nwith great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally ? to the original city slickers , billy crystal has shown that he\'s more than the world\'s best oscar host . \nhe does , however , have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last year\'s father\'s day and this year\'s my giant . \none wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project . \nsurely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there . \nperhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success . \nor maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movie\'s somber tone . \nthe most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day . \nthis one-joke movie\'s single idea is to place real-life basketball player gheorghe muresan , who stands seven and a half feet tall , into as many visually striking situations as possible . \nsammy ( crystal ) , an agent currently without clients , is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max ( muresan ) . \nafter throwing out constant one-liners ( \" either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car . \" ) , \nsammy decides to get serious , seeing max as his meal ticket . \nand although he doesn\'t like it , he\'s willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a half-dozen dwarfs . \n ( the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever . ) \nafter a series of missed opportunities , the comedic part of the movie is over , and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie . \nwe learn that max\'s condition is terminal , and he will soon die . \nto be fair , the movie does contain a few good scenes - all of which you can see in the trailers . \nlet\'s hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie . \nmy giant runs too long even at just 1 : 37 . \nit is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up . \nmy son jeffrey and his friend matthew , both 9 , gave the movie a single star and had nothing good to say about it . \nmatthew pointed out that it \" is not as good as it could have been or should have been . \" \n ( amen . ) \nhe went on to comment that he did not like the way the movie changed completely in the middle . \njeffrey complained particularly about how gross the movie was . \n'
?,'talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters ! \nspice world is the feature film debut of the pre-fabricated pop band , the spice girls . \nit\'s intended as a sort of hard day\'s night , but ends up simply hard to watch . \nwhen watching the spice girls , i\'m reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick ( such as from the smurfs , the snorks , or teenage mutant ninja turtles ) in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name . \nthe spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles , and about as talented . \nthere\'s ginger ( geri halliwell ) , the brainy one , sporty ( melanie chisholm ) , the athletic one , baby ( emma bunton ) , the childish one , posh ( victoria adams ) , the fashion-conscious one , and scary ( melanie brown ) , the one with a tongue pierced back so far you\'re almost certain the post sticks out her throat . \nthe film itself doesn\'t really have a plot . \nit follows the girls as they travel here and there , culminating at their \" first live performance \" at albert hall . \nthe action , however , seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas . \nthe various misfires include : an alien encounter , a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls , the shooting of a spice girls documentary , a movie producer ( george wendt ) trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie ( nearly all of which , though incredibly far fetched , seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up ) , a meeting with a pregnant friend ( whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends ) , a boating adventure , a bus race , club-hopping ( wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd . . . even \nwhen they start to sing ) , and an assorted number of musical performances , press conferences , and general all-around celebrity stuff . \nwhew . \nfor some reason , the film is littered with star cameos . \nfrom elton john to elvis costello , from bob hoskins to meat loaf . \nheck , even roger moore shows up , though he can\'t decide if he\'s parodying himself as james bond , or if he\'s lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld . \nrichard e . grant has the largest secondary part , a thankless role of the band\'s manager , clifford . \nthe celebrity spotting is partially amusing , and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film . \nneither amusing or spontaneous , when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring . \ntheir songs are alright , but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos . \nmy advice to fans is : stay home and watch that video collection , or at least spin that cd a couple of more times . . . either \noption will be more enjoyable than the film . \nnon-fans should know to stay well away from this one . \n'
?,'earth is a harsh , unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent . \npeople who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict , as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets : indian and pakistani ; muslim , hindu , sikh , parsee . \nthe story takes place in lahore , which was indian before partition , and pakistani afterward , regardless of what its citizens might call themselves . \nthe action is seen through the eyes of lenny ( maaia sethna ) , a young parsee girl , but it is really about her nanny , shanta . \nshanta has a small circle of male admirers . \ntwo of the men are suitors : hasan ( rahul khanna ) , a hindu , and dil navaz ( aamir khan ) , a muslim . \nthe others--sikh , hindu , muslim--are older ; some are married ; but all appreciate shanta , who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das . \n ( she also starred in deepa mehta\'s previous film , fire , the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water . ) \nin an early scene , the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny ; political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears . \none of the men remarks , jokingly , that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along . \nhe is wrong : the men make barbed little comments to each other , spoken like jokes , but with an undercurrent of fanaticism . \nthe tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses . \nit is easy to perceive , in these squabbles , the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter . \nthe group around shanta represents , in a sense , a united india , and shanta herself the ideal motherland--one which all love , which inspires hindu , muslim , and sikh to live peacably together . \nbut the circle around shanta is sundered , as is the state . \na sikh is persecuted , hides , then flees . \nanother man is murdered . \nthe group of friends will not meet again . \nthe movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction : a plate shattered on the floor , a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child , and , most brutally , when the tension escalates into violence , a man is held down , tied between two cars , and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles . \nit is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully . \nthe crux of earth\'s plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz . \nhis sisters are killed in brutal fashion , by hindus , because they are muslim . \ndil navaz seeks solace from shanta , and asks in desperation that she marry him . \nbut she loves hasan , and tenderly refuses dil navaz\'s offer . \nthe combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him , and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality : the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate . \ndespite the things he later does , it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him , but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things . \nthe conclusion--the consequence of dil navaz\'s transformation--is rather abrupt . \nthe story earth tells does not end . \nit just stops . \nit is an appropriate finish : giving us closure would have imparted , at least on an aesthetic level , a sense of resolution , of satisfaction . \nbut there was no resolution for india and pakistan--they have been at war , on a small or large scale , for decades . \nsince the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation , it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus . \nthere is no healing to be had , no closure , on any level ( despite the needless , tacked-on ending , with voice-over narration from lenny as an adult , framing the story ) . \nearth is , in some ways , an unexceptional movie . \nit does not reinvent the wheel , following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas . \nbut deepa mehta\'s directon is assured , and the issues she addresses run deep . \nearth does for india what movies like zhang yimou\'s to live and tian zhuangzhuang\'s the blue kite did for china : they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history . \nsuch films strike me as inherently valuable , even when flawed . \nthey may be biased or inaccurate , but they bear the weight of human hardship , and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other , more inventive films , often lack . \nit is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries : the events shown may have happened decades ago , but they still touch a nerve . \nthe issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year . \nin the near future , india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other . \nat the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen ; after seeing earth , i have a much , much better understanding . \n'
?,'one of the responses those that enjoy \" detroit rock city \" ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i\'ve given the film might be something like : \" oh , that casey\'s gone and become a jaded critic on us . \njust what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n\' roll movie like this ? \" \ni\'m wondering the same thing . \ni feel like i should have had a grand time with \" detroit rock city . \" \nit\'s the sort of movie i wish i could\'ve had a lot of fun with , but i didn\'t . \ni just didn\'t . \nsurely this film isn\'t trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ? \nno , but i expected something . \na funny joke . \na clever prank . \na plot development . \nanything . \nthe movie never delivers . \nyou\'ve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing . \n \" detroit rock city \" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film\'s existence , and it\'s not a very satisfying realization . \nthe film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan . \nthat\'s it . \nthere is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot . \nthe characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) . \nthey have a garage band . \nthey\'re pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n\' roll , so i guess that means we root for them . \nthey have tickets , they lose them . \nthey get more tickets , they lose those too . \nthey come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire . \nthere\'s not much more to it . \nfrankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys\' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity . \noh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency . \nshe doesn\'t want them to see kiss , if you hadn\'t figured that out already . \nit\'s really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this . \nwe\'ve got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy . \nthen again , \" maximum overdrive \" had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time . \n \" detroit rock city \" doesn\'t quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close . \nin fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind . \nbasically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half-hearted cover of ac/dc\'s \" highway to hell \" sounds like something my neighbor\'s cat coughed up ) . \nit\'s also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it\' s evident that they\'re all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie . \nedward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they\'ve got to make a living in hollywood . \npeople wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song . \ntoo bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess . \ndirector adam rifkin knows he hasn\'t got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning . \nwe get an endless parade of quick-cuts , split-screens , zoom-outs , zoom-ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script . \nit\'s fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting . \ni would recommend that those who felt seasick at \" the blair witch project \" stay far away from \" detroit rock city , \" because the witch has got nothing on this baby . \ni haven\'t felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since \" armageddon . \" \nand what about that script ? \nit\'s written by carl j . dupr ? , which sounds like as made-up a name as i\'ve ever heard . \nif it is , i can\'t say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible . \na plotless , pointless rock n\' roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny . \nthe jokes in \" detroit rock city \" rarely are . \nin fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana-laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal . \nthe rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it \" comedy . \" \nthere is no set-up , just a succession of punchlines that don\'t provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set-up . \nit\'s as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , \" see ? \nfunny ! \" \nlook , that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink . \nsee ? \nfunny ! \nlook , that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver . \ntwice . \nsee ? \nfunny ! \nlook , that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money . \nsee ? \nfunny ! \na word of advice to mr . dupr ?

?,'i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory . \nthis was , of course , a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this . \nnot only did i get to see an advance screening , i was able to see an advance screening of a * very good * movie . \nthe very fast-paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher , a fast-talking , witty , comical taxi driver in new york city . \ngibson\'s performance is terrific , and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films . \ngibson again teams up with richard donner , as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick , and this time around , the combination works even better . \nthe character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique . \ntry to imagine a toned-downed version of travis bickle who , this time around , is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover-ups . \nif you can imagine that , then you\'ve basically got jerry fletcher . \nin many ways , i was surprised by this movie . \nto begin with , i was surprised at how good it was . \ndon\'t get me wrong , it\'s not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring , but it was a very enjoyable movie . \nsecondly , i was surprised at mel gibson\'s performance . \nhe provided a fantastic performance . \nthe previews of this film led me to believe it was an all-out action flick , which after viewing , it was almost the opposite in a certain sense . \ngibson\'s character has an almost uncountable number of one-liners , hilarious situations , and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film . \nfor instance , jerry\'s apartment ( and especially his security ) is memorable . \nand last , i was surprised at how good the plot is . \nwriter brian helgeland has created a terrific story , and when watching this film , you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher\'s far-fetched ( or so they seem at first ) conspiracy theories are helgeland\'s own opinions . \nmel gibson isn\'t the only stand-out in the film . \njulia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton , the department of justice employee who can\'t seem to stay away from jerry fletcher , who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories . \nhe also seems obsessed and in love with her . \nbut whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories , she shrugs him and his beliefs off , continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him . \njerry , obviously determined to continually seek out the truth , continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory , which will be printed in his newsletter ( same title as the movie ) . \nalthough he only has five subscribers , he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work , and publishes his next edition . \nvery soon after he does so , he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr . jonas ( patrick stewart ) . \nafter barely escaping alive , jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust : alice sutton . \nthe remainder of the film is almost always fast-paced and full of action and suspense , with jerry\'s life being constantly put into jeopardy . \nand more along the way , the audience ( and alice ) learn more and more about jerry\'s life . \nmany things are explained throughout this film , both to the characters and to the audience . \nfor instance , the meaning of the book \" the catcher in the rye \" and its ties to assassins , the reason lone gunmen have three names ( e . g . \nlee harvey oswald and james earl ray ) , and the real truth behind the grateful dead . \nmake sure listen closely throughout the film , as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above . \ndefinitely , when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th , make sure you are standing in line to see it . \ni am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film , especially if you are into an action-thriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations . \nand even if you aren\'t , you should still like this film . \n'
?,'funny how your expectations can be defeated , and not in good ways . \nthe ghost and the darkness promised ( at least , it seemed to me to promise ) a hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature . \nwhat it delivered was mystery science theater 3000-level material -- an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters . \n \" get new jobs ! \" \nwas one line , if i remember correctly . \nat the end of the 19th century , col . patterson ( val kilmer , whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr ) is an engineer who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda . \nhe is having immensely stereotypical problems : the natives are restless , his boss is a jerk , and now two man-eating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off . \npatterson tries to handle the situation himself , incompetently , and then turns to charles remington ( michael douglas ) , a hunter of world reknown ( or something like that ) . \nthe movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions , they should have gotten top billing and co-starred with siegfried and roy . \nthey are nigh-invulnerable , as one comic book put it , and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature . \ngive me a break . \nthe movie hasn\'t got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas ; it\'s just trying to find convenient ways to stall us . \neven the lion hunts themselves are idiotic . \nget this : remington\'s big plan is to build a large scaffold-like structure in the middle of the savannah , sit on it , and wait for the lion to show up . \nhe does this , and then gets knocked off by a bird . \nby the end of the movie , the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand . \nthe acting is forgettable . \ndouglas does a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow , but it\'s nothing he hasn\'t done before . \nkilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else , somewhere else , and the rest vanish into the cinematography . \nthe camera , by the way , sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent . \nwhat did i expect from this movie ? \ni dunno . \nsome real excitement , i suppose . \na sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation . \nno such luck . \ni dug out my tattered copy of hemingway\'s \" the short happy life of francis macomber \" and read that to get the taste of this movie out of my mind . \n'

?,'the computer-animated comedy \" shrek \" is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups . \nfor children , it offers imaginative visuals , appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces , loads of action and a barrage of big laughs ( including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances , apparently a requisite in contemporary family films ) . \nfor adults , it\'s a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids . \nall in all , \" shrek \" is a snappy ride , although there are a couple of points i found disturbing . \nbut first the basics . \nbased very loosely on a 1990 children\'s story , \" shrek \" follows several momentous days in the life of the title character , a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using . \nshrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp , until a local nobleman disturbs his peace . \npetty tyrant lord farquaad ( take away the \" awk \" in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one-liners ) owns the land on which shrek resides . \nhe proceeds to turn the ogre\'s yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle . \nas a result , shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice , pinocchio , the big bad wolf , the seven dwarfs , and the three bears , to name but a few . \nan enraged shrek storms to the castle , only to find farquaad ( john lithgow ) ready to bargain . \nlord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from \" snow white \" has shown him the way . \nall he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife . \nthe mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of \" the dating game \" ( when snow white is shown , the cheeky announcer purrs , \" even though she lives with seven men , she\'s not easy ! \" ) \nfarquaad selects the lovely princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) and offers shrek a deal : if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon-protected , lava moat-filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne , the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds . \nshrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest , accompanied by a motor-mouthed donkey ( eddie murphy ) determined to make the green grump his best friend . \nthey finally hook up with the princess , only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet . \nfor the matter , the dragon offers a few surprises as well . \nthe movie references a great many other flicks , from \" babe \" ( \" that\'ll do , donkey . \nthat\'ll do \" ) to \" the graduate . \" \nbut the lion\'s share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney . \nthe public-domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits ? pinocchio is referred to as a \" possessed toy \" and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin , he bellows , \" get that dead broad off the table ! \" \n ? but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad\'s royal domicile , which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom , from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like \" it\'s a small world . \" \nwhich brings me to disturbing point number one . \ni laughed at all the disney swipes , but found the mentality behind them a bit sad . \nthe acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known . \nfor years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other\'s film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day . \nand now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer . \nhere\'s a suggestion for the two boys : grow up ! \nput the past behind you ! \nthere\'s room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can\'t play nice , then go to your rooms ! \nthe other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad . \nbeyond all the irreverence , \" shrek \" actually has a message : people should learn to look beyond physical appearances , because true beauty lies within . \nit\'s a lovely notion , but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad\'s diminutive stature . \ndo we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable ? \nthe pompous , selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers . \nadding short jokes is simply mean . \nstill , \" shrek \" is a rollicking good time . \nthe computer animation is mostly impressive ( although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky ) , the voice work is strong ( particularly from eddie murphy ) , the laughs come fast and furious , and the moral , tainted though it may be , is a good one . \nto trot out a clich ?

\nrather , why write him into the film ? -give \nhis almost-witty one-liners to serious willis , who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter , firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig . \ni\'m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel , at least in my world where the sky is blue . \nliv tyler is pretty and humourless , as always ; suspiciously , four of her father\'s band\'s ( \" aerosmith \" ) songs grace the soundtrack . \ndirector michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick , like ketchup , eventually drowning the movie on-screen . \n ( the middle hour is a non-sensical , pyrotechnic assault on the average primate\'s brain . ) \nwhenever someone dies in this movie , a crew member inevitably yells out \" we lost ( insert dead person\'s last name here ) ! \" \ni must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil-guy-cum-astronaut from a live one , and close-ups of the corpses\' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance , as their skin was often covered in fake blood . \narmageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla . \nit looks nicer , and has fewer plot-holes within its equally ludicrous framework . \nit has a vivid soundmix . \nbut at almost two-and-a-half hours , i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story . \nthe love story has been played up in the ads , perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic-fever . \nbollocks ! \nthe lovers in the film are miles apart throughout-erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car-sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon-crawler . \nremember a little film called jaws ? \nin this film , three independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark . \nthey didn\'t much like each other at first ; eventually , they started to respect one another . \none of jaws\' great scenes involved the would-be-ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories . \nthis is the sort of male-bonding foreign to bay or his producer , jerry bruckheimer , who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we\'ll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end . \nnot once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances-i\'d be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before \" action \" was called . \na male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don\'t bare their souls , who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest-beating bravery . \nto this , i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic , nor brave , nor smart , even : this team couldn\'t build a birdhouse . \nand if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-a trailer for a movie written by a team of body-builders and greeting card authors-i\'ve never been a prouder wimp my whole life . \n'
?,'the long kiss goodnight ( r ) meryl streep tried it and failed . \neven pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her well-bared assets . \nhowever , geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight , a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband , renny harlin . \ndavis plays samantha caine , a mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years . \nwith the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey ( samuel l . jackson ) , she slowly remembers--and reclaims--her past as charly baltimore , tough-as-nails cia operative . \nneedless to say , with the reappearance of samantha/charly comes the appearance of an assortment of no-goodniks out to erase more than her memory . \nshane black netted a cool $4 mil for his script ; i\'m not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag , but for what it\'s worth , it delivers the goods . \nlike black\'s previous work , such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout , the script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny , quirky dialogue . \nthe humor especially works well in this case , for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously . \nbut there\'s no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell : who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car . . . \nwhile ice skating ? \njackson and davis make a good team . \njackson is funny as ever as ever ; in fact , his spirited line deliveries , especially when he first appears , are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction . \nas good as he is , the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis , who shows much promise as an action heroine . \nwhat makes her so effective and why she should succeed where streep and lee failed is that she doesn\'t take herself too seriously . \nshe is obviously in on the joke , slyly taking jabs at herself and at the situation . \nthis is not to say that she doesn\'t need work--sometimes she lays on the \" toughness \" a bit too thick and comes off too much as a caricature . \nbut should the public embrace the film and , in turn , the notion of a kick-ass female , davis could have found her special niche . \nit seems as if davis and harlin\'s first collaboration , the middling pirate epic cutthroat island , was just a dress rehearsal ( albeit a very costly one ) for long kiss , in which the wife-husband team hit their action stride . \nanyone simply looking for a fun , escapist entertainment that requires little-to-no thinking will find this film to be a more-than-welcome kiss . \n'
?,'logical time travel movies are a near-impossibility . \nconsidering that the skeptic\'s best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities , writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task . \noccasionally , we get a film that does manage it . \nterry gilliam\'s \" 12 monkeys \" was one such film . \nbut more frequently , we get films that don\'t much deal with it at all . \nthere is one question to ask in this case : does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies ? \nthe \" terminator \" films made up for them with exciting action , \" back to the future \" did it with an entertaining story , and the new film \" frequency \" pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own . \nis \" frequency \" filled with plot holes ? \nyes . \ndoes it matter ? \nnot really . \nthe film opens in october of 1969 . \nfirefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job , then goes home to his loving wife julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) and son johnny ( daniel henson ) . \nthe double-pronged story flashes forward to 1999 , where johnny ( now jim caviezel ) is all grown up and working as a police detective . \na strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city -- allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in \'69 and that john has found in the present day . \nthough both are initially skeptical of the idea , john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire , and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom . \nnow flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive , john is initially overjoyed , until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous : a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women . \nfrank and john now must work together to set things right , with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past . \nthe premise of \" frequency \" is unusual , and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept : john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions . \nthis isn\'t explained ; you just have to go with it . \nwhen frank doesn\'t die in a fire , john is the only one who remembers it differently , while everyone else remembers it the new way . \nthe concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other . \nsometimes frank\'s changing the past results in something happening right away in john\'s world , and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time . \nnow , the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this , and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted ( but nevertheless logical ) if i thought about it hard enough ( for example , the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer\'s murders was because the change had already happened in frank\'s world , and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change ) , but explanations aren\'t really the point . \nwhen \" frequency \" gets cooking , it\'s a riveting little thriller , even if it is confusing . \nwhat matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment , and \" frequency \" works as long as it keeps moving . \nthe film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion . \ndirector gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure \" frequency \" as good hollywood entertainment , establishing decent , likable characters , making us care for them , and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved . \ni liked many of the creative touches : the split screens , allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities , and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward . \nit actually uses the 1969 mets-orioles world series ( the one that featured the amazin\' mets ) to great effect -- frank uses john\'s advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him . \n ( admittedly , this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself . ) \ni even liked the final scene , which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods . \nsome may find this scene blindingly confusing , as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious , but it does make sense if you think about it ( and give the script a lot of leeway ) , and let\'s face it : it\'s a darn cool way to end the film . \nthere are enough surprises and plot twists in \" frequency \" to keep you on your toes , and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant . \nthe other major thing to appreciate about \" frequency \" is the handling of the father-son relationship . \nquaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily ; it\'s a rock-solid job from both actors . \nthe relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept : how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative , or with a future descendant ? \nwatching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question . \nthe credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film ; if we don\'t believe in the characters , we don\'t care about the outcome of the thriller plot . \nhere , we do care , because we like the lead actors . \ni also liked some of the supporting cast members . \nelizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles , playing julia the doting wife * and * mother , but still performs admirably . \nandre braugher , late of the television show \" homicide : life on the street , \" gives a nice supporting turn as frank\'s best friend and future colleague of john . \nhe has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank\'s world series predictions come true before his very eyes . \nbraugher strikes the perfect facial expression here , simultaneously dismayed and amused . \nperhaps the only thing i didn\'t like about \" frequency \" is the overly sentimental coda , during which the camera\'s focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard . \nbut that\'s only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics . \ni freely acknowledge that \" frequency \" may best work as a \" guy \" movie , since it focuses on the very male-oriented idea of father-son relationships ( echoes of \" field of dreams \" can be easily heard ) , but the underlying concept is universally applicable . \nwho wouldn\'t want to speak with a long-dead parent ? \nor see how their children turn out ? \n \" tell me about your life , son \" -- excuse me while i mist up . \nand don\'t call me a sissy . \n'

?,'tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie . \nthe film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage , and , while it\'s evident that this could be a fascinating live production , the translation to the screen is a creative disaster . \nenduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious . \nthe qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium . \ntectonic plates has a storyline , although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences . \nit\'s not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all-but-screaming , \" look ! \nart ! \" ) , \nalthough it keeps the audience distanced from the characters . \nbecause we\'re constantly made aware that we\'re watching a play or a movie , it\'s impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer\'s ideas . \nthey\'re not real , sympathetic , or believable . \ni\'m willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different , but this particular experiment is not a success . \ntectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac ) , an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor , jacques ( lapage ) . \none day , he disappears , and , fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love , madeleine travels to venice to kill herself . \nwhile preparing to commit suicide , she encounters drug addict constance ( celine bonnier ) , who causes madeleine to re-think her decision . \nmeanwhile , jacques has moved to new york city , where he starts cross-dressing , calls himself jennifer , and becomes a successful counter-culture talkshow host . \nwith settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland , supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf/mute , and cultural references that point to chopin , george sand , and jim morrison , tectonic plates is unique , if nothing else . \nhowever , as interesting as the film sounds ( and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising ) , it never really delivers . \nthe tone is soporific , the supposedly-intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting , the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner ( although it doesn\'t take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant ) , and the symbolism is obvious . \ntectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth , but it takes one-hundred minutes to get across this transparent point . \nthere are some worthwhile moments , such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages ( although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren\'t bilingual ) . \nthe only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because ( a ) it\'s different , ( b ) it\'s not like anything they\'ve seen before , and ( c ) it\'s pretentious . \nfor everyone else , it\'s not only a waste of time , but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage . \n'

?,'a bleak look at how the boston underworld operates , a film which was based on the best-seller by george v . , higgins . \nit is seen through the weary eyes of a 51-year-old , small-time hood , eddie \" fingers \" coyle ( mitchum ) . \nhe got the nickname when a mob boss in his underworld element shut the draw on his hand as a punishment . \nhis current dilemma is that he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a 3-5 year stretch in new hampshire , something he feels will be a life sentence for him since he doesn\'t think he could survive prison at his age . \nhe is also concerned that his wife and three kids will have to go on welfare . \nhe could have cut a deal and gotten off , if he turned his boss over to the d . a . , but he figured he would never live if he did that . \nhe is currently gun-running for a gang of very successful bank robbers led by scalise ( rocco ) . \nthe masked bank robbers operate by always first going to the bank manager\'s house and holding his family hostage and then they go to the bank and force the manager to open the vault for them or else his family gets it . \non one of the heists , they kill a bank officer who pushes the alarm . \ncoyle\'s best friend is dillon ( boyle ) , a hit man for the mob , working as a bartender . \nhe is a permanent stoolie for the treasury agents , as an aggressive young agent named foley ( jordan ) , who likes to be called uncle , gives dillon breathing room to operate some of his low-level crime activities and to work the bar even though he has a prison record , as long as he keeps getting valuable info from him on things happening with the gangs . \nwith the sentencing date closing in on him , the already convicted coyle is out on bail and looking for an angle to cut his jail time . \nhe contacts agent foley and gives him a few inconsequential tips and then decides to do something that goes against his grain . \nthinking he made an iron-clad deal with foley to get his sentenced squashed in new hampshire , he gives him the place where a sale of machine guns is going down , knowing full-well the young hustler ( keats ) selling the guns is a lot like he was as a youth and when arrested will be facing a life sentence . \nbut foley tells him after he arrests the gun-dealer , that new hampshire wants more before they take away his jail sentence , they want him to be a full-time informer . \nwarning : spoiler follows in next paragraph . \nthe bank robbers are setup and caught in the act and the mob boss is convinced coyle did it and gives dillon the contract to take care of his friend . \nthe contemptuous dillon befriends coyle and treats him to a steak dinner and takes him to a bruin hockey game while getting him boozed up . \ncoyle takes a look at the young bruin star bobby orr from his upper deck seat and says , \" to be young like that and have his future , he\'s the greatest hockey player in the world . \" \ndillon then takes the drunken coyle for a long drive and executes him mob-style , having a kid who works for him dump the body in some bad section of boston . \nthis is a great atmospheric film due to the realistic noir mood it sets , of the hopeless situation the low-level criminals are in , and how they are forced to live with fear and the uncertainty of what horrible thing will happen next . \nthe city streets are ugly , the gangsters are shown to be capable of any action to defend their own interests , whether it is betrayal or murder . \nthere is a fatalistic feel about their lives , something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat . \nmitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs , as it overcomes a thin plot . \nit makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them . \nmitchum is a loser ; and , that he lived so long , is a tribute to his skills as a survivor . \nbut in the end , he even loses the respect he had among his underworld friends as a standup guy , as he wrestled with his code of honor and lost even that battle . \n'
?,'numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci-fi , suspense thrillers . \nsoldier is a multi ? crossbreed between the likes of terminator , aliens and offspring . \nthe problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel ? not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground . \nbesides this , the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age . \nthe fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured , slow and sluggish , and could have done with better choreography . \nrussell who is usually a good actor in b-grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character ? sergeant todd , who seems more like a sergeant toad . \nbesides having almost no dialogue , his character appears stunted , zombie-like which is in line with his screen persona , but scores little points of empathy with the audience . \nthis movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson , whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth . \nalthough this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former , it is still a long way from anything considered desirable . \n'
?,'based on the boris karloff\'s classic by the same name , the mummy starts off with the high-priest of osiris , imhotep , who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible -- bandaged up , having his tongue removed , and being covered in flesh-eating scarab beetles , then entombed . . . all while still alive . \nrecap a few thousand years later , where a soldier named rick ( played by brandan fraser ) aids a young historian named evelyn ( played by rachel wiesz ) and her brother , jonathan ( played by john hannah ) in finding the book of amon ra , in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy . \nproblem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress , using evelyn as a sacrifice . . . \nwalking in with relatively low expectations , i thought this movie was actually pretty good . \nthe visuals and cgi are astounding , and obviously not cheaply done at all . \nthey pack a ton of detail into the images , especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi . \nthe computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes , such as unnerving moments involving flesh-eating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him ( after all , those who took his artifacts are cursed ) . \nunfortunately , the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time , becoming a tug of war for control between genres . \non one hand , it is a fast paced action film . \non the other , it\'s a frightening horror film . \nand on the side , it\'s a hilarious comedy . \nideally , for it to be successful , the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect , with one character serving as the comic relief ( that would be johnson ) . \nthe problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief , with rick occasionally delivering his witty one-liner . \nif they were trying to make a horror-action-comedy , it would have helped if it were established early on in the film , but unfortunately , with the backstory of imhotep\'s entombment , that would be impossible . \nand then there\'s the slapstick fight scene between a sword-wielding rick and an army of mummies . \nwhile really well done , it had the feel of slapstick comedy . \nreplace the sword with a chainsaw and you\'d effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness . \nwhile entertaining and funny , it feels really out of place . \nbut at least it\'s a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of . \non the whole , the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end , entertaining the audience . \nbut i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners . . . turn \nthe sound down ! \nwhile a lot of theatres have good sound systems , my ears were almost ringing as i walked out of the theatre ( the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if you\'re not careful ) . \nwhen they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film , \" end of days \" , it was so loud i couldn\'t make anything out . \n'
?,'is evil dead ii a bad movie ? \nit\'s full of terrible acting , pointless violence , and plot holes yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release . \nexplaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots ( including the original evil dead ) is extremely difficult . \n`well what\'s it about ? \' \n`five people stranded in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from a variety of ugly , hairy , wart covered monsters . \' \n`come on i saw a movie just like that on monster vision last week . \nwhy should i see it again ? \' \n`no evil dead ii is different , it\'s funny . \' \n`it\'s funny to see people die ? \nare you sick or something ? \' \nmaybe i am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie . \nhis unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle , as disturbing as it is hilarious . \nan example of raimi\'s odd approach : a monster ( formerly protagonist ash\'s girlfriend of all people ) is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound . \nsure it\'s over-the-top , but it is so over-the-top that it is laugh out loud funny ; just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood , staining his face and knocking him back a few feet . \nthe whole movie is like this , watch ash get beat up , watch ash defeat the monster , watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster . \nthe more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets , the more amusing it becomes . \nno matter how sick it may sound , it is funny to watch bruce ampbell\'s ash get his butt kicked every five minutes . \nand raimi takes advantage , he has ash tormented by the head of his girlfriend , by the body of an old lady , even by his own right hand . \nlike the less superior idle hands , we watch ash uncontrollably hit himself over and over again until he is forced to cut off his own body part . \nbut it doesn\'t end , ash now has to fight his severed hand which now moves with the same celerity as thing from the addams family . \nall of these events , thrown at you from minute one with roller coaster- like camera movements , at first become shocking , then inexplicably funny . \nraimi expects the audience to laugh and as the film progresses , he seems to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing the classic mirror scene from the marx brothers\' duck soup , then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off . \nwith a running time of less than an hour and a half , raimi gets away with the impossible , making a horror film with more gore than plot and intentionally more laughs than scares . \nending evil dead ii with an opening for the third film in the series , raimi obviously had a lot of fun making this movie and couldn\'t wait to make it\'s sequel . \n'
?,'it\'s rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year , but that is what disney and pixar animation ; s latest film represents . \nwhile a bugs life isn\'t nearly as deep as it\'s predecessor , dreamwork\'s antz , it is just as funny . \na bug\'s life centers , appropriately , around the life of an ant , named flik . \nflik , cutely voiced by newsradio\'s david foley , hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task . \nwhen one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost , the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way . \nthe offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them . \nthe leader of the grasshoppers is hopper , who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey . \nwhen the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food . \nwhen the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission , they never dream he will be successful , they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food . \nflik\'s mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return . \ninstead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs , who he mistakenly assumes are warriors . \nwhen he returns with the `warriors\' , the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes . \na bug\'s life has animation that is simply stunning . \nthe sheer uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative . \ntogether with the great voice acting , this film is the perfect holiday family film . \nits main weakness is that it couldn\'t beat antz to the theaters , making it seem like stale material . \n'
?,'>from the commercials , this looks like a mild-mannered neil simonesque tale with mary tyler moore baring her bra touted as the highlight . \ninstead it turns out to be a hilarious film running in high gear from beginning to end . \nthe concept is deceptively pedestrian . \nan adult adopted son is looking for his biological parents and encounters eccentric characters along the way . \nthe movie demonstrates just how far a good script and actors can take a mundane idea . \nthe son and his wife take off on the search accompanied by a woman from the agency who located his parents . \nfollowing one dead end lead after another , each funnier than the previous , they eventually end up in new mexico with his real biological parents : alan alda and lily tomlin . \nit\'s difficult to condense the mile-a-minute plot . \nseemingly hundreds of scenes jump on top of each other without giving you a chance to recover from the last one . \nwithout giving too much away , one of the better episodes involves a gay federal alcohol , tobacco and firearms agent attempting an arrest while tripping on lsd as his bi-sexual partner is upstairs licking the armpit of a woman while her husband is in the next room seducing their traveling companion . \nand it\'s all done in a fairly clean , almost ( well , maybe not exactly ) family fare manner . \na grand cast ( tomlin , alda , moore , ben stiller , patricia arquette , tea leoni , george segal ) interacts in a seamless parade of laughs . \ndrawing from a more hyper woody allen style , the film succeeds beyond expectations . \n'
?,'i\'m not quite sure how best to go about writing this review . \ni must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson\'s political satire \" wag the dog , \" but in retrospect , this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it . \nquite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through , and it didn\'t do that . \nthey also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all-too-true attack on the way the american political media works , and it didn\'t quite do that either . \na few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick\'s \" dr . \nstrangelove \" in the tradition of political black comedy , and it most definitely didn\'t do that . \nthat said , \" wag the dog \" is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them . \nthe story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean ( robert deniro ) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president , who is up for re-election in two weeks , sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office . \nthe accusations , the script suggests , are probably untrue , but as brean so pointedly puts it , that isn\'t particularly relevant : the scandal is likely to derail the president\'s campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood . \nbrean , along with his assistant ( anne heche ) , decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss ( dustin hoffman ) to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special-effects trickery to make it appear that the u . s . is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor . \nas i said , \" wag the dog \" is not quite as laugh-out-loud hilarious as i had expected , but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here , such as when , in an echo of a familiar movie clich ? , the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting , inspirational music , then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform \" we have the right to fight for democracy . \" \nanother scene shows us how , with modern editing equipment , an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village . \nthe most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team\'s attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt . \nwilliam \" old shoe \" schumann ( woody harrelson ) , an ex-military officer who turns out to be a first-class psycho . \nof course , not everything goes as planned ; the cia , for example , realizes what\'s going on and strikes a deal with the president\'s electoral opponent to report to the media that the \" fighting \" has ended , forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis . \nstill , even with the cia\'s involvement , the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable . \nregardless of the official word from the president or the cia , wouldn\'t the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is , in fact , no fighting going on in albania ? \nthe film never addresses this question , nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical , such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt . \nschumann ; we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it . \nthere was also an instance , towards the end of the film , in which one of motss\'s forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away . \nwith these plot holes , \" wag the dog \" doesn\'t quite work as a satire of american politics , but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place . \nbrean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical ; rather , they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off . \nthe film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end , as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret . \nmotss and his hollywood buddies , meanwhile , seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project . \nin fact , one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss\'s increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war ; in his mind , it is the greatest work of art he has ever created . \ni think it\'s fair to say that \" wag the dog \" underachieves a little bit : more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four-star film and a classic satire . \nstill , the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one . \nwag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks , what if the war wasn\'t even real ? \nwith this premise and the talented cast , the film still delivers more consistently than most , whatever its flaws . \n'
?,'capsule : a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg . \njoe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs . \nit lets us see some new dinosaurs ( is that an oxymoron ? ) and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure . \nthe film is neither ambitious nor pretentious . \ni had a good time . \n , low +2 ( -4 to +4 ) \nhere goes my credibility . \nthis is a film on which i expect to be in a minority . \ni liked the third jurassic park film . \ni even liked the second jurassic park film . \nin a lot of ways jurassic park : the lost world was a creative three-way braiding together of michael crichton\'s novel the lost world , arthur conan doyle\'s novel the lost world , and the classic silent film version of the doyle . \njp2 was an adventure , as doyle said , \" for the boy who\'s half man or the man who\'s half boy . \" \nthat is what all the jurassic park films are . \nexpecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house . \nthe classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon\'s mines had under-written characters also . \njurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs . \nthe characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be , and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting . \nsome of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds . \nthat degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require . \ni feel i got my money\'s worth . \nthe story opens with eric ( played by trevor morgan ) and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica . \nthis was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park . \nthey hope , no doubt , to get a look at the island\'s dinosaurs from a safe height . \nthe height is safe , but driving the boat in the water is not . \nthe two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended . \nflash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant ( sam neill ) in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide . \nhe has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs . \nbut again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go . \ndoing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple ( william h . macy and tea leoni ) who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs . \nthey too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn . \nhe will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once . \nright . \nguess what happens next ? \njp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2 . \nfirst it has alan grant and ellie sattler ( laura dern ) back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm . \nsattler has a much smaller part in jp3 , but is still present to tie this story to the first . \ncuriously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance . \none thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other , suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time . \nthey did not appear to be conversing in the previous films . \nof course , these raptors look a little different also , so perhaps they are a different related species . \nnot only are they more intelligent than in the past films , they are also more sympathetic . \nin this story they are not just killing machines , they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition . \nthis time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized . \neach new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs , of course . \nin this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus , not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus , but larger and presumably more nasty . \nit has a crocodile\'s head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright . \nperhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs . \nsometimes they just move too fast to see . \noccasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision . \na few times we get unconvincing matte shot , particularly of the laboratory . \nbut there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films . \nthe musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williams\'s score for the first film . \njoe johnston , who directs , already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky . \na team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay . \nthe film they have made is a long way from great cinema , but it still is fun . \nif you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today , the film is for you . \ni rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n'

\nnope . \nluckily she\'s on the tv dancing so we get to see her . \nsurprisingly enough , when i read the screenplay ( about a year before actually seeing it ) , this one seemed to have the most potential . \nit was fast-paced , funny , and well , funny . \nbut when i watched it , it seemed anti-climactic and only seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once . \nantonio overacts nicely and the two kids ( lana and danny ) are funny . \nbut , as i said , it moves slowly and in that way , it\'s more painful than funny . \nbut the ending was stupid and funny at the same time . \noh ! \nthe plot : antonio is a supposed gangster ( assumed , really ) who leaves his two troubling kids home while he and his wife ( tomita ) go out to get drunk at a new year\'s party . \nantonio hires ted for a couple bucks to watch his kids all night long , but things go wrong . . . it \nwas okay . \nthe man from hollywood writer/director : quentin tarantino starring : quentin tarantino , bruce willis , paul calderon and jennifer beals ( again ) \nironically , this one could be considered the best for a bad reason : it best represents what quentin has done with this film . \nhe plays chester , a spoiled brat actor or something who has just had a huge box-office hit on his hands and is living it up by playing an anti-climactic game from a hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble to see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in a row . \nthey\'re drunk and need sober but nervous ted to hold the cleaver and bring it down if the lighter doesn\'t light . \nthey also pay him a lot of cash . \nthis is so much exactly what this little film is about that it\'s campy . \ntim roth was probably payed a lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film made by a bunch of people who are high on themselves \'cause they\'ve had hits , major or minor . \nit took quentin to realize that . \nbut the thing is , it doesn\'t seem like he realizes that . \nif he did , i\'d give this a good 3 stars . \nbut this sucked . \nit was anti-climactic and the dialogue wasn\'t very good . \nhe starts off with a very long steadicam shot then goes to flashes . \nthat makes no sense . \nit\'s cool for a while , then he makes it uneven . \nit\'s long and it\'s just not very good . \nhopefully quentin never repeats what he did with this one . \nconclusion : what\'s the moral here ? \nif you\'ve made celebrated films , don\'t do an ensemble piece . \nthey should have re-watched \" new york stories \" and then stopped in their tracks . \nnone of these have any point to them and they\'re embarrassing to not only the writer/directors , but to the actors \'cause they\'re working with crap . \nbut i will forgive everyone involved and i especially look forward to quentin\'s next directing job ( even though he and rodriguez jumped back to the top immeadiately with the cool \" from dusk till dawn , \" which i found exhilerating ) . \ni love quentin and i suppose it\'s good he made \" the man from hollywood \" because it makes him seem more realistic and not some \" god of cinema . \" \ni seem to respect directors if they aren\'t \" gods \" and are actually human beings who make mistakes . \n \" the man from hollywood \" is his big mistake and let\'s hope he doesn\'t return her continuously . \n'
?,'there\'s more to a quilt than fabric and thread--each patchwork design has its own unique story ( or stories ) to tell . \nin how to make an american quilt , the first hollywood release from australian director jocelyn moorhouse ( proof ) , we come to understand how the tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion and vitality . \nall the sorrows , joys , longings , sufferings , and loves of these women are sewn into their quilt and , as their bittersweet memories are given expression , one young woman applies these lessons of the past to her own uncertain future . \nmotion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals ; how to make an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine alternative . \nthe \" quilting bee \" consists of seven members : sisters gladys ( ann bancroft ) and hy ( ellen burstyn ) ; sophia ( lois smith ) , a woman known for frightening children ; emma ( jean simmons ) , the timid wife of a perpetually unfaithful man ; constance ( kate nelligan ) , who has been having an affair with emma\'s husband ; anna ( maya angelou ) , the leader of the group ; and marianna ( alfre woodard ) , anna\'s daughter . \nthe project they\'re busy with is the wedding quilt for hy\'s granddaughter , finn ( winona ryder ) , who has just become engaged . \nshe\'s spending the summer with hy and gladys , and away from her fiance , to decide whether a lifelong commitment is really what she wants , and whether it\'s better to marry a friend or a lover . \none of the greatest pleasures of how to make an american quilt comes from watching an array of fine performances by an impressive ensemble cast . \nfrom winona ryder , ann bancroft , ellen burstyn , and maya angelou to minor players like rip torn , claire danes , and kate capshaw , this film is overflowing with realized talent . \nthe performances are good enough , in fact , to cover up many of the script\'s weaknesses . \nhow to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable , if affecting , tale of love across the generations--a sort of truncated american version of the joy luck club , with a dash of fried green tomatoes added . \nthere are probably too many characters . \nso , instead of really getting to know a few of them , we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives . \nwe learn about the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys and hy , and are told the reasons why emma stays with her husband and sophia is so irascible . \nthere are other episodes as well : the love of anna\'s life , marianna\'s soul mate , and a look at the reasons why constance entered into an affair with her friend\'s husband . \nthe sum total of these tales is meant to provide the framework for finn\'s story : whether to go forward with her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger . \nthere is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt . \nthe stories are all well-told , but it\'s difficult to really connect with the characters--their moments pass so quickly . \nwhile we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals , our emotional investment is tenuous . \nthere isn\'t enough depth to pull the viewer in all the way , and many of the personalities and relationships feel half- formed , like a quilt with patches missing . \nto put it bluntly , while i enjoyed watching this film , it didn\'t \" do much \" for me . \non the whole , how to make an american quilt is a nicely-understated drama that has a lot to say about love , passion , and monogamy in relationships . \nfinn\'s segment is by far the most compelling , because she\'s the focal point : her actions are shaped by everyone else\'s experiences . \nthe other patches of this american quilt are successful only to varying degrees . \nif there\'s a disappointment here , it\'s that the script doesn\'t have more resonance , but the privilege of seeing such a fine cast in top form allows a viewer to enjoy this picture even if the story is somewhat conventional . \n'

?,'urban legend surprised me . \nbased on the last few films the genre has produced ( including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer , disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween : h20 ) , i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena . \nthankfully , legend rose above it\'s soggy premise to become not only a hip , scary and stylish entertainment , but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year . \nyou\'re all familiar with the plot ; a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who\'s identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be , you guessed it ; everybody\'s favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks . . . the \nonly person you didn\'t suspect ! \nhowever , just because legend doesn\'t really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it can\'t qualify as first-class entertainment . \nit was , believe it or not , one of the funnest times i\'ve had at the movies all year . \nthe thing is , i\'m not really sure what made this particular stab ( pardon the pun ) at the genre seem so fresh and alive . \nmaybe it was the above-par performances by the movie\'s two leads ( jared leto and \" cybil \" actress alicia witt ) . \nor , it could have been the on- target direction by jamie blanks . \nmore likely , though , it was because of the inspired premise . \ni don\'t think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman . \nurban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener , not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film . \na pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when ( gasp ! ) a gas problem ( hee-hee ) forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill . \none problem , though . \nwould you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif ? \ni thought not . \npredictably , the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out a problem with the credit card company . \nit\'s odd , though , when you pick up a phone to realize that nobody\'s on the other line . \nnaturally , the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off . \nand the when we least expect it . . . whack ! ! ! \na decapitation . \nit turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car . \nso who is it this time ? \nthe obvious candidate is the slightly off-kilter professor at the college the girl went to ( none other than freddy kruger himself , robert englund ) , who teaches a class on urban legends . \na-ha . \nor could it be the fame-hungry local journalist ( leto ) looking for a meaty story to put on his resume ? \nlike all movies of this nature , one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit . \nand it turns out to be , of course , the one you didn\'t suspect . \ni\'m not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is , but i must give credit where credit is due . \nand this flick definitely deserves credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been . . . fun . \n * complimentary movie ticket courtesy of valley cinemas in lodi , ca \n'
?,'what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just a predictable , lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project . \nmost of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films . \njohn frankenheimer , who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early 60\'s , recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in ronin . \nscreenwriter ehren kruger gave a remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated arlington rd . \nben affleck displayed his comedic talents in dogma and boiler room , and even on saturday night live directly after the horrible forces of nature and 200 cigarettes . \neven charlize theron , who i was convinced couldn\'t act , did a decent job in cider house rules . \nwhen all of these bright stars come together , one would assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining . \nafter coming out of the theater showing reindeer games , disbelief was my first reaction ? then frustration . \nthe movie could have premiered on cinemax at two in the morning starring an all-rookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining . \nthe acting is so pitiful and the script so dull , i may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are . \nit seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights . \nwe have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set , it is so apparent in a number of scenes in good will hunting when he exchanges jokes with his friends at a bar . \nthe actors in that movie were having fun and , from that , the audience had fun . \nreindeer games is the complete opposite ; the actors don\'t seem to want to be their characters ( even danny trejo , who will do practically anything , doesn\'t look like he is enjoying himself ) , causing the audience to quickly lose interest . \nevidence of public disapproval was noted when a woman behind me yelled \" boy this movie is horrible ! \" \nand when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments . \nthe story follows a man , rudy ( ben affleck ) , who is leaving prison in a few days along with his best friend and cellmate nick ( james frain ) . \nnick has been exchanging love letters with a beautiful woman , ashley ( charlize theron ) , and cannot wait to leave prison and meet her in person . \nwhen nick is killed in a prison riot , rudy decides to pretend to be nick and take ashley out on a date for the christmas holidays . \nunfortunately ashley\'s brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) interferes with their relationship . \nthinking rudy is nick , he kidnaps rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino , which nick use to work at as a security guard . \nnow rudy must pretend to be nick so he can protect ashley from her brother gabriel . \nconfused ? \nthe movie only gets more complex as it goes on , until it gets way , way too complex at its climax . \nbut reindeer games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an hour . \nthe hero commits a greedy , selfish act when he decides to pretend he is his dead cellmate in order to date ashley . \nsome hero . \nthe point of a hero is to do the morally correct thing , a person for the audience to relate to or admire . \nwhen rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble , instead of gathering support from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys , i felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times . \nthe most irritating part of the film ( besides the fact that this is a christmas movie released in february ) is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason . \nthe routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays , especially when i eagerly want to see the hero dead . \nthe only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an amusing but pointless cameo from isaac hayes as a prisoner upset with his food . \nwhy he was in this movie for such a pointless role beats me . \nwhy any of these people had anything at all to do with this movie beats me . \n'
?,'one of the last entries in the long-running carry on series , carry on behind is very similar to carry on camping in that it involves a group of holidaymakers descending on a \'caravan\' site . \nprofessors anna vrooshka ( elke sommer ) and roland crump ( kenneth williams ) and a group of archaeology students stay in the caravan site owned by major leep ( kenneth connor ) so that they can explore the nearby roman settlement remains . \nanna has a little trouble understanding english and sometimes people get the wrong end of the stick : - for instance , when anna is asking for \'scrubbers for dirty caravan\' , she means that she wants a scrubbing brush to clean the caravan ! \narthur upmore ( bernard bresslaw ) and his wife linda ( patsy rowlands ) take her mother daphne barnes ( joan sims ) and her minah bird on holiday with them . \nmother-in-law jokes prevail . \nfurthermore , the trouble that joe and norma baxter ( ian lavender and adrienne posta ) have with their large irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families . \nfred ramsden ( windsor davies ) and ernie bragg ( jack douglas ) leave their wives ( liz fraser and patricia franklin ) behind for a fishing holiday . \nhowever , they have more in mind than fishing when they catch sight of two young girls , sandra ( carol hawkins ) and carol ( sherrie hewson ) . \nthe story involves the disruption caused by the archaeological professors of the day-to-day running of the camp , the search for the minah bid and greyhound , the major , fred and ernie\'s desperate need of a woman , a misunderstanding leading to a striptease at the caravan park\'s pub , and a shock in store for daphne . \nthe partnership between sommer and williams is very effective and amusing . \nthis is what binds the movie together . \njoan sims stands out as the demanding mother-in-law , bernard bresslaw and patsy rowlands work well together as husband and wife , and carol hawkins and sherrie hewson are a welcome addition to the cast . \non the other hand , there are low-key performances from kenneth connor and peter butterworth as barnes the handyman , and there are very poor performances by windsor davies and jack douglas who spend far too much time on the screen ! \neven though there is no real plot to speak of and the jokes are getting bluer due to the new scriptwriter dave freeman , there are enough truly comical moments and bright and breezy performances to lift this carry on above many of its predecessors . \nalthough the regular cast is depleted , the ones that remain show that they can still make a good carry on film . \na relative flop at the cinema , this movie deserves a lot more recognition . \n'
?,'writers : dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh ( based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer ) \nstarring : jamie lee curtis , william baldwin , donald sutherland , joanna pacula , sherman augustus , marshall bell , cliff curtis , julio oscar mechoso \ni suppose i\'m not extremely surprised that \" virus \" comes to us from a deciple of james cameron ( john bruno ) , and if i strain real hard , i could even say that it\'s an obvious given , particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr . cameron\'s early works . \nin fact , \" virus \" is yet another in the long line of action/horror/paranoia thrillers from the \" aliens \" vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally-threatening entity is out to get them , a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies , and maybe even to the first pictures , albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future . \nno such thing will happen to bruno , whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi-landmark feature ; while bruno may have studied under cameron\'s wing for years and years , i\'m beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him . \nin fact , \" virus \" should at least be mediocre ; the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like \" virus \" is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z-grade schlockfest of a film , albeit a z-grade schlockfest with a respectable budget . \nthe film seems to not only borrow it\'s plot from last year\'s similarly-fated \" deep rising , \" but also from a clunkish b-movie from the \'80s called \" leviathan , \" an underwater thriller starring peter weller , richard crenna , hector elizando , and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part \" alien , \" part john carpenter\'s twisted remake of \" the thing . \" \n \" virus , \" again , has a similar , uh , selling point : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water . \nthey get on . \nthey break up into pairs and investigate . \nand they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy , has taken over all the machines on board , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses , and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha ) . \nnot that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond-ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) , destroying any of the suspense in what could happen , but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters . \nof its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential-romantic-interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper . \nand it\'s not the traditional argument for films like these , where you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even \" aliens \" played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers , but this was more of a plus-side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead , as another cliche goes , you just don\'t give a damn . \ni almost don\'t even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub-par to horrific , the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and she is , just not really here ) and the latter being - and it pains me to say this as he\'s a particular favorite of mine - donald sutherland , who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance-of-which-he-should-be-ashamed . \nlike anthony hopkins for \" legends of the fall \" ( the line \" scrooooooo \'em \" has been thus embroidered upon my membrance ) . \nor peter o\'toole in \" caligula . \" \ngreat actor , horrific performance . \nit happens every now and then , and it only helps sutherland\'s career that no one , except for an elite few , even bothered to see this film . \nthough it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years , waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can ( read : early january , when everyone\'s still trying to catch up on the potential oscar-nominees ) , it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film : it\'s laden with complex machinery , boasts respectable production design , and it may even feature believable special effects . . . if , of course , i , or anyone else , could see them . \n \" virus \" mostly takes place on a large , abandoned cruiser , and mostly at night until the dawn , and mostly without the use of lights , not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey , but more so because , as the hollywood cliche seems to go , \" if it\'s dark enough , then the special effects will be more believable . \" \nand if you don\'t believe me , go back and rent \" godzilla , \" and tell me if there\'s even one shot where we see godzilla either a ) in his entirety in one wide shot , or b ) n the light so that we can at least see him ( well , you don\'t really have to sit through it again ; just take my word for it ) . \nbut all of this doesn\'t matter since \" virus \" is basically just one loud , cluttered mess of a movie . \nthe action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i\'ve ever seen ( my , um , favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship , during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves , rain , and any other ocean-extremeties the film can cook up , then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned - well , i must say , thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldn\'t figure it out when i saw it ) . \nimagine the first attack of the aliens in \" aliens , \" shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity , and that\'s basically the whole of \" virus \" : one horribly-directed action scene after the other , capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members . \nand my god , it\'s a long damn sit . \nwith no interesting characters , no dramatic urgency , no tension , not one good moment of action , and no mesmerizing visuals , it\'s a wonder that it even got made . \nwe already know that big movie studios\' mentality is shallow at best , and movies like \" out of sight \" and \" saving private ryan \" give you more faith in them , but movies like \" virus \" manage to drain a little more out of the pool . \ni almost wish that instead of making this movie , john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light . \nthey read the script , they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack ( and he is ) , and they still went ahead with the project , only to have bruno and company shit back in their face . \neven though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie , i\'d say even more contempt should be aimed at mr . bruno for making a movie that could be this bad . \nin fact , shouts of \" egad , man , what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway ? \" \nare not only justifiable , but encouraged . \n'

?,'the thirteenth floor , the third in what i would call \" the reality check movie series \" , is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year , the matrix and existenz . \nall three made you think , made you wonder what is real , what isn\'t , and if our world is just a huge game . \nthe thirteenth floor doesn\'t reach the level of originality , creativity , and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz , but it certainly gives a great shot at it . \nin the matrix , we were told that the humans are simply a virus . \nin existenz , we learned that our life could be just a game . \nin the thirteenth floor , we learn that we are just electronic devices , living under another world of electronic devices . \nthere is just one world on top of another , and everything in them are fake and electronically generated . \nthe thirteenth floor took a huge , risky turn that i didn\'t expect it to take , and i\'m not very sure it was such a great turn to make . \nrather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film , the thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds . \nafter the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller , played by armin mueller-stahl , douglas hall , played by craig bierko , a man that worked under fuller for many years , must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using , to the year 1937 , which consists of computer generated characters only . \nthe simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden days . \nall of the people involved are just characters , or are they ? \ndouglas strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours , and killed fuller . \nalong the way , douglas interacts with many different potential suspects , and a woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller , jane fuller , played wonderfully by a talented young actress , gretchen mol . \nthe thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going , and doesn\'t use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewer\'s interests . \ni was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz , and i wouldn\'t enjoy it , but there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive to the film . \nunfortunately , many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content , letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened . \nthe scenes that aren\'t original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere , leaving you wondering , \" what is the point of this ? \" \nsometimes it was hard to believe that this story , with terrible dialogue , some bad acting , especially from craig bierko , and scenes that go absolutely nowhere , are actually true . \ni know this isn\'t a true story or anything , but a film should be able to make you think that it is . \non the plus side of acting , we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in 1995 actor , armin mueller-stahl . \nin the thirteenth floor , he is back and is still giving believable and amazing performances . \nanother plus is gretchen mol\'s realistic performance , creating her character with depth , not just staying in the one-dimensional phase . \ndon\'t expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor , just expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile , and shuts you down like any other movie would . \nthrills , chills , and spills aren\'t what you will get in this film , but you will just get another trip to send your mind on , scrambling it until you\'ve had enough . \nthe bottom line- let\'s hope this is the last of the \" reality check \" based movies for awhile . \n'
?,'i tried hard not like this movie without succeeding . \nit contains parts of bringing up baby , any hepburn/tracy film , part of the plot of war games , cary grant and rosalind russell in his girl friday , elevator shaft action , train action , and murder . \nit is cute , funny , suspenseful ( a little bit ) , sexy ( a little bit ) . \none of the bad guys was a surprise . \nthe pace is fast enough , there are some \" action \" scenes . \ni think that this is a reasonable family summer movie for families with older kids who have already seen maverick . \njulia roberts and nick nolte are fine separately and together . \ni really identified with the julia roberts character ( wishful thinking , i know ! ) , but i do have better hair ! \nher hair , a very dull dark brown , has no color . \nshe could use some highlights . \nthey both do fine with their roles : he\'s a bored columnist with the chicago chronicle and she\'s a hotshot \" cub \" reporter with the chicago globe . \nthey have great fun trying to out scoop each other to solve one case throughout this movie . \ni like the one story focus . \nother actors include charles martin smith as roberts\' boss , olympia dukakis as nolte\'s coworker , nora dunn also with the chronicle , and marsha mason as a congresswoman . \nbasically this movie is reasonably fun . \nthere is a serious mystery to solve , and i enjoyed following a fun couple solving the mystery . \nit is a pleasant change of pace from movies that take themselves seriously . \ni do give successful comedy high marks . \n'
?,'i\'ve never been a member of the robin williams fan club . \na little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way , and i sometimes feel as though i\'m watching a 40-year-old class clown . \nin his films , williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy-feely emotion , leading to wildly uneven performances . \nmrs . \ndoubtfire seemed ready-made for the same problems , but instead it proves to be williams\' best comic screen project yet . \nwhile it still contains some characteristic self-indulgence , mrs . \ndoubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly-laugh comedy served up with high energy . \nwilliams stars as daniel hillard , a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior . \none such incident proves one too many for wife miranda ( sally field ) , and she files for a divorce . \nunemployed , living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children , daniel decides to respond to miranda\'s ad for an afternoon housekeeper . \nhe turns to his brother frank ( harvey fierstein ) , a theatrical makeup artist , and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire , a matronly 65-year-old englishwoman . \ndaniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on miranda\'s flirtation with a wealthy client ( pierce brosnan ) , to spend time with the children , and to learn something about responsible parenting , all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best . \nmrs . doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work , and basically it does so . \nthe most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel , and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that\'s instantly believable . \nit may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film , making dustin hoffman\'s dorothy michaels look like milton berle . \nmore problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell ; it\'s a bit hard to swallow that she doesn\'t recognize any of the voices as her husband\'s . \nperhaps the biggest contrivance we\'re asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs . doubtfire in a few minutes . \nthere\'s more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask . \nfortunately , these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll . \nduring the film , i was generally too busy laughing . \nafter getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams\' riffing , mrs . \ndoubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place . \ndaniel\'s frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful , as is the climactic restaurant sequence , even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away . \nclearly , most of the credit for doubtfire\'s success goes to robin williams . \nit took putting him in drag , but for once he plays a comic character that isn\'t just robin williams with a different name . \nhe thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire , and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foul-mouthed . \nwisely , he never aims for saintly . \nhis responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty , but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity . \nit\'s one of mrs . \ndoubtfire\'s charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect , just people trying to be better . \nas miranda , sally field is solid in a background role , and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu . \nthe children are also good , although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest . \nthe supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing . \nit\'s easy to see mrs . \ndoubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over , and it\'s true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common . \nbut mrs . \ndoubtfire manages to carve out its own space , particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judge\'s decision and the ultimate status of daniel and miranda\'s relationship . \nthere\'s nothing dazzlingly new in mrs . \ndoubtfire , but there are plenty of laughs , and good comedies are always in short supply . \nand it\'s nice to see robin williams just act for a change . \n'

?,'there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie . \naction movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences , while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full-circle . \nfor fans of both genres , however , realism is key . \naction fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic , and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie\'s end . \non this advice , director john frankenheimer ( the island of dr . \nmoreau ) strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller , ronin . \nthe depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing , considering the fare that\'s fallen into the same category over the last few years . \nthe script , written by j . d . zeik in his big-screen debut , approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission : impossible two years ago . \na certain number of people will be lost by this , but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times . \nfrankenheimer masters the script with poise , and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of post-cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck . \nhis ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here , and ronin becomes a better movie because of it . \nrobert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time . \nhe takes command and offers much gravity as the ex-spy sam , a man who\'s called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre ( natascha mcelhone ) recover a package . \nthe package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast , especially once the requisite double-crossing begins , and its role is skillfully penned by zeik . \nat times , however , zeik\'s tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission : impossible - de niro might easily become tom cruise , the package might become cruise\'s computer disk . \nfortunately , the focus here is almost entirely on the package , whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the double-cross and why it happened . \nthe action content is impressive , and it lives up to the hints given in previews . \nthe only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full-blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness . \nronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish , but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots . \nthe suspense tapers off considerably by the end , a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movie\'s open . \nconsidering these factors it\'s good to see that ronin was a project that turned out well , and it\'s another good bet this month . \nsince quality is usually sparse during the early fall months , it\'s definitely worth the visit . \n'

?,'with the success of the surprise hit alien , directed by ridley scott , a sequel was inevitable . \nin fact , after watching the first film , a sequel was wanted , particularly by this reviewer . \nhanding over the director\'s chair to recent box office gem james cameron , who had only made two films previous to this one ( pirahna ii , a surprisingly dull film , and terminator , making cameron a household name ) , the alien series got a face-lift of immense proportions . \ninstead of being a suspense/science fiction film , cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture . \nwhat results is one of the most terrifying films ever created . \na film like aliens comes along only once in a while , and when it does , audiences are usually unprepared for it . \ni never saw this movie in theaters , but i wish i could have . \nthe terror and fright must have been unimaginable , most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear . \naliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen . \nwith a science fiction plot , cameron gives aliens added testosterone , pumping up the action and fire power from the original film . \nin fact , aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original . \nperhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero--or heroine , as the case may be . \nnever have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film , and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character . \nsigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about . \nplacing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual , but because of weaver\'s presence , a woman is the only suitable hero . \naliens begins 57 years after alien ended . \nlieutenant ellen ripley ( weaver ) is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened . \nshe explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens , but \" the company \" is doubtful . \nthey explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left . \ndespite stern warnings from ripley , the company remains rigid and won\'t call the families back . \nhowever , when the company loses contact with the colony , ripley\'s story seems much more feasible . \none of the company\'s directors , carter burke ( paul reiser ) , wants to gather a team to travel to the planet . \nthis team includes a buff private vasquez ( jenette goldstein ) , a questionable corporal hicks ( michael biehn ) , and a loyal android bishop ( lance henriksen ) . \nburke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony . \narriving on the planet , the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoon-type environment . \nthe only survivor is 12 year old rebecca \" newt \" jorden ( carrie henn ) . \nripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become , and she becomes newt\'s surrogate mother . \nripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened , and soon , all hell breaks loose . \naliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott\'s version , it also multiplies the number of aliens in general . \nalien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member , except ripley , who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo . \naliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens , and as a result , the chills are incredibly heightened . \nthen again , this is james cameron , the guy who has given us true lies and terminator 2 : judgment day . \nhe is the best action director out there ( topping renny harlin , who directed cliffhanger ) , and only he could create something as terrifying as this film . \nit seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes , and aliens has the motherload . \nwith perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film , aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion . \ni can\'t recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout , never dropping for a moment . \njust when you think the movie is over , something else will occur , and it starts right back up again . \nwith a seemingly endless conclusion , aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history . \nthis scene is usually the one remembered most from the film , as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen . \nusing flawless special effects , the climax is exhausting , leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety . \nof course , for a film of this genre to work properly , the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see . \naliens is completely realistic , even a decade after its initial release . \nthe special effects are wonderfully seamless , with a terrifying alien to go with them . \none of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music , composed by cameron-regular james horner . \nhorner has created a terrific score , receiving an oscar nomination for his work . \nnot only that , horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film , or science fiction film ever ( and that includes 2001 : a space odyssey , which was mainly a compilation of well-known composers ) . \nin fact , the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music . \nthe production design is incredible , which also happened to snag a nomination from the academy . \ndark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive , but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from well-lit locations . \nnormally a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer ; aliens uses lights to scare the viewer . \nthen , of course , is the cinematography , which uses point of view shots , along with video feeds in order to build suspense . \nsome of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley . \nsurprisingly , the acting is not only above average for this genre , but some of the best . \nsigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley , incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hard-edged persona . \nweaver soars above the rest in this film , but she is supposed to . \ncarrie henn gives an above average performance for a child , developing a three-dimensional character from her quiet attitude . \nlance henriksen is terrific as bishop , showing that androids don\'t always have to be flat characters . \njenette goldstein shows a fair amount of enthusiasm with her role , and steals several scenes of her own ( though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isn\'t fighting ) . \nmichael biehn gives a very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film . \nhowever , biehn does a good job , making it seem original again . \npaul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director , but reiser manages to pull it off quite well ( however , i still see him as paul on tv\'s \" mad about you \" ) . \na very good cast ( which also includes bill paxton and william hope ) highlights this action film , making it stand out from others . \naliens is rightfully rated r for violence , gore , language , and terror . \naliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre , as alien was more of a suspense/horror film . \naliens pumps up the stakes , and cameron directs it with professional quality . \ncameron certainly knows how to make a good action film , but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen . \ntechnically astonishing , aliens\' only flaw is small characters who are only there to get killed . \naside from this , you probably won\'t experience anything like aliens for quite a while . \n'

?,'in 1977 , something never though possible happened . \nthe film star wars was released , with extraordinary , never seen before techniques of special effects . \nthe film set a new standard for special effects in film . \nnot only did it set a standard for the special effects , it set a standard for film itself . \nthe plot is one of the most creative i heard ever . \nthe legend of star wars starts long ago with the jedi . \nthe jedi were warriors who were wiped out by the dark side . \ndarth vader is the leader of the dark side . \nben obi-wan kenobi , played by sir alec guinness , was one of those jedi who is still alive today . \ndarth vader was once a jedi , until he turned to the dark side . \nyears after the killing of the jedi , darth vader is still around causing trouble . \nr2-d2 and c-3p0 are both what we call \" driods \" , or robots that are of assistance to humans . \nwhile an attack on the ship that princess leia , played by carrie fisher , is aboard , she inserts a message to r2-d2 , who is also on the ship . \nto obi-wan kenobi pleading for help . \nthe princess is captured by vader , but r2-d2 and c-3p0 get away on an escape pod that eventually lands them on the remote planet of tatooine . \nthe jawas , or small creatures who sell droids , pick r2-d2 and c-3p0 up to sell . \nthey are bought by luke skywalker\'s ( mark hamill ) family . \nwhile luke is cleaning the droids , the message from princess leia is found . \nluke finds this obi-wan kenobi , and learns that obi-wan was a friend of luke\'s father , who is now dead . \nluke also learns his family was a jedi . \nafter luke\'s family is killed by tropps from the dark side , ben decides to put luke through training to stop the dark side and destroy them once and for all . \nben wants to create a new jedi . \nfirst , the two must find princess leia and serve her . \nhan solo , played by harrison ford , and his sidekick chewbacca , played by peter mayhew , are consulted about providing a ship to complete the tasks necessary . \nafter meeting up with leia , the film really picks up . \nluke continues his training as a pilot and to become a jedi , ben kenobi confronts darth vader , and many other interesting events occur . \nstar wars is an amazing epic . \nthe plot is so original and amazing , i cannot believe it . \nthe special effects , especially for its time , are wonderful and realistic . \nthe space scenes in particular are the most fun to watch . \nthe ships flown by all are very unique and creative . \nthe costumes are also out of this world . \nthe scenery is so different from anything i have ever seen before . \nthere are a variety of different very memorable set pieces that will stay with me forever . \nthe entire premise of star wars is amazing . \nthe creatures and droids that we see throughout the film are one of a kind . \neven the human characters are different . \nevery character is extremely likable and different from characters from other sci fi films . \nthe acting on everyone\'s part is great , especially that of sir alec guinness\'s . \neven though the concept is not realistic at all , it is pulled off very nicely . \nthe acting , setting , effects , costumes , and sound make it work . \nif any of these were messed up , star wars would have come off as one huge joke . \nthe ending works very well , and left it very open to the sequels that came afterward . \nin early 1997 , a special edition of star wars was released . \nthe film was re-mastered so it looked better than it did in 1977 . \na few creatures were added here and there , and even an entire deleted scene with han solo and jabba the hutt ( seen in return of the jedi ) was added to the film . \nthink that\'s enough ? \non may 19 , 1999 , star wars episode i : the phantom menace will be released , followed by two more films that will reveal what went on before a new hope . \nwith this , star wars is bound to become the greatest tale told in our time . \n'
?,'if you want some hearty laughs , then rat race is the movie for you . \nthis unpretentious little comedy , which sneaks into theaters today with very little hype , will have you bouncing in your theater seat . \nand while the film fits neatly into the low-brow , slapstick school of comedy , one refreshing aspect is its lack of mean-spiritedness . \nthe plot follows a group of people chosen at random by an eccentric las vegas casino owner ( john cleese ) who must race from vegas to a bus station locker 700 miles away in silver city , n . m . \ninside the locker is a duffel bag containing $2 million . \nthe first one to open the locker , gets the bag and the money . \nwhat the group of participants doesn\'t know is that cleese\'s donald sinclair ( \" i can do anything i want - i\'m eccentric ! \" ) is staging the race as a betting game for a group of high rollers at the hotel . \nthe participants include vera ( whoopi goldberg ) and merrill ( lanai chapman ) , a newly reunited mother and daughter ; disgraced pro football referee owen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) ; italian tourist mr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) ; randy pear ( jon lovitz ) and his family ; the bumbling con men duane and blaine cody ( seth green and vince vieluf ) ; and cynical young lawyer nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) . \nvarious amusing encounters and mishaps befall the participants en route to silver city . \nscreenwriter andy breckman adds a nice touch by not having the racers try to sabotage one another . \nthe most side-splitting situations involve vera and merrill\'s encounter with the squirrel lady , a nice nutsy cameo by kathy bates ; owen\'s commandeering a charter bus full of lucille ball look-alikes on their way to a lucy convention ; the cody brothers misadventures with a hot-air balloon , a flying cow and a monster truck ; and the pear family\'s stopover at a barbie museum , which turns out not to be what they think it is . \nthe pear family situation is a fine example of the way breckman\'s script builds the laughs . \nwithout going into detail , this bit segues from the museum to hitler\'s touring car , to eva braun\'s dark lipstick , to lovitz burning his tongue , culminating at a ceremony honoring world war ii veterans . \nrat race\'s cast is first rate . \ncleese is wonderfully devilish and madcap ; lovitz is , at first , a bit whiny , but his character grows on you ; gooding is having a fine romp ; and dave thomas almost steals the show as cleese\'s deadpan assistant , a man \" born without a personality . \" \nthe film is directed by jerry zucker , who knows something about comedy . \nalong with his brother , david , and friend jim abrahams , he was responsible for such hits as airplane ! \nand ruthless people . \na throwaway subplot , which is good for some laughs , features cleese and his buddies , betting on a series of outlandish situations , including one dealing with a hooker and pepto-bismol . \nthis is a fun little feature . \nthe only letdown comes at the finale , which is too touchy-feely and sweet , almost negating what came before it . \nrat race is a summer sleeper , but it will keep you awake , as will the laughter of those watching around you . \n'
?,'not a great twelve months for either of the principals from this movie . \nearlier this year , nora ephron wrote and produced one of the year\'s least likeable \" comedies \" called hanging up , featuring a bunch of annoying women ( ironically , lisa kudrow played one in that film as well ) who barely have time to care about anyone but themselves . \nick . . . real \nsweet stuff . \nbut her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared to what john travolta went through earlier this summer , with a film entitled battlefield earth . \ni seemed to be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated the film , even if it was on a \" cheese \" factor , as everybody , and i mean everybody else , pretty much classified the movie as one of the worst disasters of all time . \nyipes . . . another \nbeauty . \nso what happens when you put these two people in the same room and come out with a movie co-starring the ever-versatile lisa kudrow ? \nuhhhm , you guessed it . . . not \nmuch . \nplot : in order to escape major financial difficulties , a local weatherman hooks up with his ball-picking lotto girlfriend and rigs the state lottery . \nbut as more and more people find out about their scheme , more and more people demand a part of their winnings , and more and more problems arise . \ncritique : simply stated , i didn\'t laugh once during this entire picture . \nfor a comedy , it offered me a few smiles , a bunch of nincompoops as characters , a miscast john travolta hamming it up and lisa kudrow , in what can only described as a \" sluttier \" version of her character of phoebe on tv\'s \" friends \" . \nthis film was not as disastrous as i thought it would be , but it was pretty close . \nthankfully , the clips of travolta dressed up in goofy outfits , dancing as the weatherman were left in the film\'s trailer , and not in this final cut . \nand not unlike the worst movie of the year so far , beautiful , this film also managed to feature many unsympathetic , idiotic and just plain irritating characters in its cast . \nforemost was travolta\'s character , who declined to give us any reason to care for him once in the entire movie . \nand for me , the casting choice of john travolta for this role was just plain wrong . \nhe didn\'t fit the part . \ni just saw him in get shorty the other day and thought about how perfect he was for that role . \na cool , calculating roughneck with a certain hip , suave \" je ne sais quoi \" . \nin this film , he looks like he\'s trying to be funny , trying to be bad , trying to be good . \nwe\'re not supposed to be able to notice that , and when we do , at least in my case , i consider it a wrong choice in casting . \nadd that to lisa kudrow , boring us with yet another one of her patented \" dumb blonde \" routines , but this time , dressed in sexier outfits . \nmichael rapaport , stretching one small acting muscle to play the guy who isn\'t quite up at the same speed level as everyone else . \nand a truckload of empty comedic bullet shells , and you\'ve got yourself an extremely quiet audience anticipating punch lines that never quite materialize . \nthe only real good thing that i could say about this film is that its story was actually half-interesting and never really bored me . \ni also liked michael moore\'s perverted cousin character , and i loved , and i say it again , loved the character that bill pullman played . \ngive this dude his own movie ! \nhe played a lazy cop , a man who tries everything not to do any real work . \nhe fakes injuries to get off duty , tries to avoid arrest situations so that he won\'t have to fill out any forms . . . now \nthere\'s a base of humor . \nsadly , the filmmakers decided to bring him into play with only about half an hour left in the film . \nand there\'s not much else i can say about this movie , folks . \non the whole , it was lame , included a slew of unlikable characters fiddling around in a pool of unfunny lines , and very little of interest for any target audience . \nbut get somebody to write up a movie featuring that lazy cop played by pullman and i\'m there ! \n'

?,'synopsis : a small town thug convinces a dimwitted high-school student to spy on his girlfriend , who is babysitting three unruly kids for their alcoholic parents on a friday night . \nwhile this is going on , the thug , the father , the boyfriend , and a kid reaching the onset of puberty all have fantasies about the babysitter . \ncomments : to say this movie is bad would be quite an understatement . \ni\'m not sure what writer and director ferland was hoping to accomplish with the babysitter . \nsuspense ? \nfamily drama ? \nhumor ? \nerotica ? \nelements of each of these genres exist in the film , yet it fails to successfully achieve any of them . \ninstead , the babysitter is a dull , lifeless movie which manages to bore and ultimately irritate its viewers . \ni suppose this film could have been watchable if it weren\'t for the fact that the characters are universally unappealing . \nalicia silverstone is completely wasted playing jennifer , the babysitter . \nher character has absolutely no depth at all , and her sole purpose in the movie is to be the object of the other characters\' fantasies . \neveryone else in the film seems to be in a competition to see who can stoop to the lowest level by the time the film ends . \nthe parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as the movie proceeds . \nthe father ( played by j . t . \nwalsh ) fantasizes about the babysitter ; the mother fantasizes about her husband\'s best friend . \nnone of these fantasy sequences , trust me , are things that need to be seen , but we see them anyway , complete with cheesy , make-out saxophone music . \nthe thug , in the meantime , proves that he\'s evil through his annoying habit of smashing half-empty beer bottles all of a sudden and for no apparent reason . \nthe most absurd character , however , is the babysitter\'s boyfriend who seems catatonically brain-dead . \nthe thug , in a manipulative , iago-like manner ( though he doesn\'t really need to try hard ) , manages to talk the boyfriend into binge-drinking , smoking grass , running away from cops , and playing peeping tom on his own girlfriend in a matter of minutes . \nincredible ! \n ( of course , the boyfriend\'s original plan for the evening was , try not to laugh , to sit in an empty diner and read catcher in the rye by j . d . salinger . ) \nif the goal of the babysitter was to be suspenseful , then it fails . \nthere are surprisingly few tense moments in this film , and nearly all of them come at the final minute . \nby that time , however , the audience is so tired of the inane characters that no one truthfully cares what happens to any of them . \nno suspense occurs in the dream sequences either because every single one of them is obviously a dream sequence from its inception . \nif the goal of the babysitter was to be humorous , then it also fails . \ni found nothing even remotely funny about the boozing parents who seemed , at times , to be played for laughs . \nif the goal of the babysitter was to be dramatic , then , once again , it fails . \nthe characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting . \nfinally , if the goal of the babysitter was to be titillating ( the type of film destined to be played ad infinitum on hbo at 2 in the morning ) , then it fails as well . \nthe dream sequences aren\'t erotic ; they are too brief and , outside of one very short scene , contain no nudity . \ni can\'t completely trash this movie . \nthe first 10 minutes or so vaguely resemble an interesting film , and the conclusion sports a halfway decent fistfight . \nthe other 79 minutes , though , are a drag . \nsilverstone\'s character , at the end of the movie , turns to her boyfriend and asks \" what were you thinking ? \" \ni asked myself the same question , having spent 99 cents renting this turkey . \n'
?,'working in the motion picture industry must be a constant source of frustration for a front-line african american actress like jada pinkett smith . \ndespite being one of the freshest talents available , pinkett smith has often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts ( a low down dirty shame , the nutty professor ) . \nthe problem is , of course , that there aren\'t many good roles available for black women . \ntake away the likes of waiting to exhale , set it off , soul food , and eve\'s bayou , and all that\'s left is a chance to be someone\'s girlfriend , a local whore , or a murder victim . \nas a result , for pinkett smith\'s first opportunity atop the marquee , she is stuck in a stupid , formulaic romantic comedy with the unpromising title of woo . \nactually , woo , the latest directorial effort from daisy v . s . \nmayer ( party girl ) , could have been worse than it is . \nthe film offers a few funny ( albeit juvenile ) moments and the on-screen relationship between pinkett smith\'s woo and tommy davidson\'s tim is appealing on those rare occasions when the two aren\'t forced to play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags . \nunfortunately , huge portions of the movie are insulting to the intelligence of anyone with a triple-digit i . q . \nthe situations are painfully contrived , the main characters are lifted right out of sit-coms , and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that i wondered whether they all participated in some kind of \" free lobotomy \" lab experiment . \nwoo is a spontaneous , energetic young woman who has been looking for love in all the wrong places . \nher latest relationship , with a testosterone-overdosed drug-dealer , came to an abrupt end when she refused to wear a beeper . \nnow , her transvestite/medium friend celestrial ( girlina ) predicts that she\'s about to meet mr . right , and that he\'ll be a virgo . \nlater that day , woo is given an opportunity to go out on a blind date with tim , a shy man with a penchant for neatness and order , who just happens to be a virgo . \nit\'s not love at first sight , however . \nthings get off to a rocky start when tim makes an awkward pass , and they get even worse when the pair arrives at a swanky restaurant to enjoy a \" quiet \" dinner . \nin the one-hundred year history of motion pictures , there have been a ton of bad \" white \" movies about mismatched lovers , so i suppose it\'s only fair that we get a \" black \" effort of the same low caliber . \nas in all romantic comedies , we know from the beginning that woo and tim are going to end up together . \nthe question is , are their courtship rituals entertaining ? \nin a good entry to the genre , the audience becomes caught up in the love story , no matter how familiar it is . \nin woo , the constant reliance upon unfunny , moronic humor sinks the project . \nfor those who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes , there\'s a huge one in woo involving a corvette with a broken window that miraculously repairs itself ( added to that is the mystery of how the car looses its top ) . \nsadly , that\'s one of the film\'s most enjoyable sequences , and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional . \ndespite exuding charm from every pore , there\'s little that pinkett smith and davidson can do to save their characters or david c . johnson\'s script . \nsince it misses the mark by so much , a better name for woo might have been whoops . \n'
?,'susan granger\'s review of \" mulholland drive \" ( universal focus ) \nwhatever david lynch is selling , i\'m not buying . \nfrom the writer/director of \" blue velvet \" and \" twin peaks \" comes another dark , mysterious thriller that opens with an automobile accident on mulholland drive , the serpentine street that twists high in the hollywood hills . \ndazed , a beautiful brunette ( laura elena harring ) emerges and stumbles down a hill , slipping unobserved into a \'30s-style apartment as the tenant leaves for a trip . \nthe next morning , a dewy blonde ( naomi watts ) from deep river , ontario , arrives in la with dreams of stardom in her suitcase . \nher aunt owns the apartment and the two women meet . \nthe brunette has amnesia so the blonde tries to help her discover her identity along with her latent lesbian lust . \nmeanwhile , a hotshot director ( justin theroux ) , whose wife is in bed with the poolman , is forced to cast a certain actress in his new film and there\'s an assassin ( mark pellegrino ) roaming the city . \nthe tortuous paths of these various characters - and others named cookie , coco and cowboy - intersect at various points but the plot remains elusive because , midway through the story , lynch has the brunette and blonde play two different women in an alternate reality , leaving a huge wad of cash , a blue metallic key , a paralyzed mogul and a lot of questions that go unanswered . \nelena harring and particularly naomi watts are gifted actresses , effectively making the subtle switch . \nthe same cannot be said for former m . g . m . \ndancer ann miller who\'s stiff and self-conscious , speaking - like most lynch players - in staccato tones . \non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" mulholland drive \" is a frenzied , frustrating 4 . originally designed as an episodic tv pilot , this surreal triumph of suspenseful style over substance is packaged as a puzzle with several of the key pieces left out . \n'

?,'perhaps it\'s time for me to say a little about my reading habits . \ni really do like to read , and i\'ve enjoyed many books in my lifetime . \nmy problem is that i\'m a slow reader , and not very dedicated -- i\'ll enjoy portions of a book and then set it down for months at a time ( it\'s taken me the last six weeks to get through the first one hundred pages of anna karenina , even though i\'m loving the book ) . \nin addition to this , i typically don\'t read anything created after the 19th century . \nthe only reason i bother with this bit of information is because i feel bad admitting , time after time , that i haven\'t read any of the books on which these films are based ( the only exception , i believe , is great expectations ) . \nhowever , i don\'t think it should be necessary to read the book beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film . \nneedless to say , i haven\'t read the elmore leonard novel out of sight , on which steven soderbergh\'s new film is based . \ni can\'t say how faithful of an adaptation it is , or if it lives up to leonard\'s vision . \ni can say that it\'s a terrific film , with sharp acting , great dialogue , and pumping full of energy and style injected by soderbergh . \nit\'s certainly a nice distraction from 1998\'s lineup of brainless blockbusters , all hopelessly wishing that size mattered . \nout of sight proves that it doesn\'t . \ni had originally written george clooney off as a one-note actor , incapable of depth but occasionally showing a little flair . \nafter seeing his latest performance in this film , i\'ve changed my mind -- this guy can act , but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those $20 million superstars . \nhere , he plays jack foley , a middle aged guy who robs banks for a living . \nhe does it because it\'s fun , i think , but the film opens with him getting caught because his car won\'t start . \nhe goes to jail -- which is interesting -- only to break out five cinematic minutes later with the help of his friend , buddy ( ving rhames ) . \nwe\'re then introduced to karen sisco ( jennifer lopez ) , a u . s . marshall who , conveniently , is waiting with a shotgun as jack escapes . \nfortunately , they take her hostage , and she and jack spend some quality time in the trunk together as buddy drives them to safety . \nthe central conflict arises when both jack and karen become obsessed with one another , though their respective jobs make them superficially incompatible . \nwe soon learn that the film is not told in sequence ( and , since this is a gritty crime comedy , flashbacks of pulp fiction should arise ) . \nat first , i kind of felt that it was a gimmick , but i guess it was a gimmick in pulp fiction , too . \nit\'s a fun gimmick , though , and soderbergh treats the material with enough humor that everything comes off naturally . \ni\'ve only seen a few of soderbergh\'s films ( i was impressed both with kafka and sex , lies , and videotape ) , but i think he\'s excellent at what he does . \nhe\'s an artist without making it obvious , and without being pretentious , which is always admirable . \nhe uses tricks , yes ( lots of freeze-frame stuff here ) , but it all adds to the smooth and quirky currents in the film . \nas i said , clooney is terrific , and he\'s matched by lopez . \nlopez is , of course , beautiful , but she can act , too . \ni can sense that she\'s honing in on her skills , for she comes off more natural here than she has in any of her previous ventures ( not that stone gave her much help in the loathsome u-turn ) . \nthe two actors have arresting chemistry with one another -- the best scene in the film , by far , is the seduction scene . \nthe brilliance of this scene is also due , in part , to soderbergh , for he cuts back and forth from their quiet discussion in a bar to the physical act which takes place a few minutes later . \nthe scene is a series of soft nuances and glances , layered upon light dialogue , and the result is one of the better love scenes in recent cinema -- meaningful and engrossing . \nthe supporting cast is strong , led by the always-reliable ving rhames . \ndennis farina , who plays karen\'s father , is good , as is don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villain . \nsteve zahn , who plays jack\'s nearly-brain dead accomplice glenn , steals all of his scenes ( and that\'s in a film where every scene is already at a high level ) . \nall of the actors are helped by the dialogue and the intelligently-constructed script by scott frank . \nout of sight is certainly a light film , although there are a few heavy moments that will linger in the memory . \noverall , i can recommend it simply as great entertainment . \nnot every film has to change your life , and it\'s nice to see a movie that uses the art to tell a great story and simply to entertain its viewers . \nas for the book , this film is good enough to make me believe that there might be something in the text worth looking at . \n'

?,'kadosh means sacred in hebrew . \namos gitai\'s fictional work , after spending most of his career doing documentaries , is a grim story about a failed hasidic marriage , even though the marriage is a loving one . \nthe marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israeli\'s modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidic\'s intolerable one , as both groups are vying for control of the secular government . \ngitai ( devarim/yom yom ) is a labor party leftist , who believes that if the rigid hasidic ever got control of the government , it would sound the death knell of israel . \nthe emphasis of the film is on how the ultra-orthodox jews of that sect live by the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women to accept their vision of god\'s law from only the male\'s view . \nthat if they ever got control of the country , their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are . \nthe story takes place in jerusalem\'s jewish quarters called mea shearim , where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls , and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life , which is much different than the way most jews live in israel . \nthis is a controversial film , in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones , that the film is bound to anger most viewers , no matter their belief . \nit is a slow-moving , meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go . \nthe force of what is seen , though filmed in an objective manner , never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim , is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance . \nthe film is meant to be critical of such a rigid people , as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes , it makes it impossible for them to unite the country when they can\'t at present live in harmony with their own people , and it would be even more impossible to imagine them living with their arab neighbors in peace . \nthe film opens as meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual , where every prayer is made to the virtues of god . \nhe even thanks god that he didn\'t make him a woman . \nhis wife rivka accepts the fate she was born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately according to hasidic custom . \nshe looks at him with glistening eyes , not questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her religion keeps her from studying the talmud and having all the modern conveniences of life , and from seeing movies and tv . \nmeir is a talmudic scholar . \nhis father ( abu warda ) is a rabbi at the yeshiva . \nhe has been married for ten years and his wife has not been able to give him a child . \nsince the hasidim look upon a woman\'s role in life being only to conceive children , and cook and clean house for the man , while the man\'s role is to spend his time in prayer , therefore there is an insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage . \nshe receives an anonymous letter that states \" a woman without a child is no better than dead . \" \nmeir\'s response , is that it is written like that in the talmud . \nmeir\'s father tells him that the marriage contract must be broken : \" a man who dies without progeny rips a page from the torah . \" \nall the blame is placed on rivka , who is thought of as unpure as the reason for her being barren . \nshe will go through countless ritual baths to cleanse herself , as her rigid mother ( koenig ) dunks her in the holy water and says a ritual prayer for the 12 times she is dunked as an homage to the 12 tribes of israel . \ntheir religion doesn\'t permit them to be examined extensively by a doctor . \nrivka goes on the sly and finds out that it is her husband who is sterile , but she cannot tell him that because of their religion . \nso when meir\'s father chooses a younger woman for his son , she is exiled to live alone in a cold apartment in the same jewish quarters . \nrivka\'s spirited younger sister malka does not want to get married but wants to live a more liberated life . \nshe has a long time romantic relationship with a fellow hasidic yaakov . \nbut , because of the way they were both raised , she is still a virgin . \nwhen yaakov joined the israeli army to fight in lebanon , something his sect is not allowed to do , he is thereby banished from the sect even though he is still a believer . \nhe now works as a singer in a nightclub . \nmalka\'s mother is worried that her daughter won\'t get married , so she arranges with the rabbi for her to marry yossef , someone whom she doesn\'t love . \nyossef is a very stern follower of the order , he is also a political activist who drives around the city in a sound-truck with a bull-horn urging jews to stick together and fight their godless enemies . \nthe two sisters are close and languidly discuss their options , with rivka telling her sister to accept the marriage , it will make her happy ; but , while malka is reluctantly forced into accepting it , she has other plans to ruin this bogus marriage . \nthe harshest scene in the film is on malka\'s wedding night . \nyossef prays to god for a child and then robotically gets malka to spread her legs , and without the least bit of affection , only a nervousness shown on his part for the function he supplies , as he goes inside her and rams her hard , thrusting away until the act is completed and then retiring without a word or gesture of love . \nthe sisters have choices , like everyone else in life does . \nbut the choices are obliterated by one\'s beliefs , circumstances , and inward nature , and how difficult it is to carry out those choices if it goes completely against the way one is brought up . \nfor the sisters , the choices are life or death ones . \ngitai by closing in on the daily rituals , tight living quarters and close-knit community , has shown how difficult these choices are for those who have never seen another world and have been kept in the dark all their life . \nthe film ends with the forlorn malka walking atop of jerusalem and looking

?,'a sensuous romantic comedy , about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom . \nthere is no special ingredient on the menu for what is dished out , its the kind of stuff i\'ve seen before and was made nauseous by its silly idea of love and what it thinks is funny . \nthe film plans to exploit the beauty and sweetness of its delicious star pen ? lope cruz , who plays a brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations , the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot , but who can\'t get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story . \npen ? lope was wonderful in pedro almod ? var\'s \" all about my mother , \" but here she is so visible in such a stale story , where she can only smile and tease the audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking , that she somehow looks ridiculous , as if she got egg all over her face . \nthe best you can say about her , is that she\'s not to blame for this picture being so off . \nthis exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex , is in my opinion , worst than a raunchy film that delivers what it says it will . \nthe story is all about the love , motion sickness , and cooking ability of isabella ( cruz ) , who is born in bahia , brazil and learns to cook at an early age from her parents\' cook . \nto cure her motion sickness , her parents tried every remedy , until they went to a spiritualist who prayed to the goddess of the sea for her cure . \nshe is able to control it now as long as she doesn\'t drive a car , ride elevators , follow in dancing , and is the woman on top when making love . \nin other words , she has to be in control of things . \nin her small fishing town she falls in love with a handsome macho latin waiter , toninho oliveira ( murilo ben ? cio ) and marries him . \nthey open up a successful restaurant , where she slaves away in the kitchen but he gets all the credit for it , even though he\'s a loafer . \none night she catches him in bed with another girl and decides to leave for san francisco . \nwe don\'t see her in flight , so i can\'t tell how she handled her motion sickness problem -- unless she flew the plane . \nshe visits her friend\'s apartment monica ( harold perrineau jr . ) , who is a cross-dresser , blending right into the san francisco scene . \nto cast away her love for the irresistible toninho , she calls her spiritualist friend and gets her to cast an irreversible spell , freeing her from ever loving him again . \nher luck changes when a local tv producer cliff ( mark feurerstein ) gets a whiff of her cooking and storms into her cooking class as if were in a spell and presents her with her own live tv cooking show . \nyou can really write the script from here on by yourself . . . as the despondent toninho begins to realize what a good thing he had , but things continue to go bad for him : there is a curse he caused on the fishing in his village , there is no chef to replace his wife , as the restaurant is about to close for good . \nso he comes to san francisco , figuring he can charm her again . \nhe brings along with him his guitar playing musicians , the ones he used when courting her , when he serenaded her under her window . \nhe sees his wife on tv with monica as her sidekick , the yuppie tv producer chasing after her , and sees that she is no longer charmed by him . \nwhen he sneaks on her tv show set and tries to woo her with his musical group and him singing corny love songs to her , the ratings go up and he\'s hired as a regular on the show . \nthe show gets so big , that the network honchos come onboard , taking it national . \nbut they want to change the ethnic flavor of the show , get rid of monica because he\'s a freak , have isabella cook with tabasco instead of the brazilian peppers she uses , and they change her ethnic dresses to low-cut vanna white type of sexy dresses . \ncliff , her would-be boyfriend , acts creepy and sides with the network big-shots , even though he loved everything she did . \nthese tv scenes were not only bad stereotype scenes of tv honchos , they were revolting . \nit was an insult to one\'s intelligence . \ni\'m sure that i\'m not spoiling the ending for anyone , when i tell you that toninho reforms his macho ways and together they cook up a meal that breaks her spell of loving him again . \nif the film wasn\'t terrible enough , monica and cliff act on their attraction for each other and become lovers . \nit was so awkwardly done , that it had no sense of truth or humor to it . \nthis film might as well have been made by the same network guys featured in this film , because it doesn\'t look or feel like an almod ? var film , the type of film it aspired to be , but more like a film that was interferred with from above . \nits more like a futile commercial film that is more annoying than charming and more dull than chic , as it searches for box office heaven . \n'
?,'the film \" magnolia \" can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests . \nthe dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower . \nthey all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart . \nthe numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially . \nfrom a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host , each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain . \nthey are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness . \nwhether this companion is a distant family member or a spouse , each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one . \n \" magnolia \" is a clever , well thought out film from prodigy director-writer paul thomas anderson of \" boogie nights \" fame . \nthe detailed character analyses and the powerful script make \" magnolia \" memorable . \nhowever , what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories , the film is never confusing . \nanderson\'s control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful . \nhe also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of \" magnolia\'s \" scenes drag on too long . \nany three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending . \nfrom the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesn\'t get boring . \nit is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot . \nthis is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation . \nevery character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees . \nfor example , cop john c . reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through hall\'s daughter melora walters who once went on a date with reilly . \nthe fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes , races , and genders suffer . \nanderson\'s explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing . \nthe only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously . \nthis was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it had a broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get . \nthe performances in \" magnolia \" are perfection . \nthis is a classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting . \nanderson allows many of hollywood\'s best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best , character acting . \nall of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in a feature length film . \nworth noting is tom cruise , who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into a funny but depressing tour de force performance . \nhe was probably noticed more than the other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past ( however any actor in this film could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints ) the only problem i had with the acting was that a few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillon\'s character as phillip baker hall\'s wife . \nshe seemed to be thrown in towards the end and i felt very little sympathy for her because i had not seen her enough earlier in the film . \n \" magnolia \" uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters . \nanderson has the talent to make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people in only a few hours . \nto see that anderson is able to perfectly portray this many different types of people shows that he has a keen sense of diversity . \ndiversity is what makes a director successful for a long period of time . \ni predict a lot of diversity and success from anderson in the future . \n'

?,'titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it\'s upsetting that it isn\'t . \nthe film , which cost $200 million+ to make and could of put 20th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it \'sunk\' ( pun intended ) is a labour of love for cameron , who wrote and directed the film . \nwe all know that big budget dosen\'t mean great film ( see waterworld ( 1995 ) ) but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic . \nbut sadly , titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece ( although it is one of cameron\'s best films ) \nthe film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic . \nthey find a safe , and inside a picture of a woman . \nthe woman in the picture ( an old winslet ) tells the explorers that the picture is of her . \nthe explorers invite her over , and she then tells her story of titanic . \nin the flashback , dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson , who , after winning a poker game , wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic , leaving liverpool to go to america . \nalso boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater ( winslet ) who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosen\'t love at all , cal hockley ( zane ) so her family can remain rich . \nshe nearly commits suicide on the ship , but jack comes to the rescue , saves rose , they fall in love , and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them . \noh yeah , and the ship sinks . \nand that is the main problem with the film , and which stops it from being a work of genius . \nthe story and script ( both by cameron ) are both weak . \nthe story is full of cliched characters , ( the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry , the poor boy with heart , the stuck-up mother ) and poor dialogue ( the script consists of lots of in-jokes of how the boat won\'t sink , and most of the dialogue is pretty basic ) it\'s a shame really , as the audience does have to sit through 3 hours of this film . \nwithout good dialogue , a film could become a very long , very boring film ( like camerons own terminator 2 , 1992 ) but , luckily , there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear . \nfirstly , there\'s cameron\'s direction . \nthere are some great sweeping shots of the titanic , and some clever fades between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic . \nbut the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end . \nthere is a lot of mayhem and panic , all done very well by cameron . \nit\'s a scary sight , watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below . \nthanks to cameron\'s direction , then , the audiences attention is held for the full 3 hours 15 minutes . \nto support the directing are the excellent cast , working very well with their underwritten characters . \ndicaprio is good , although he only looks 16-17 years old . \nhis performance of a over excitiable , yet also well mannered boy is excellent , and he also has some funny lines . \nwinslet is great also , and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth . \nzane is deliciously evil as cal , saying every line with a sneer and a flicker of the eye lash . \nthe audience really does come to hate him . \nhe may be playing the same character he plays in every film he\'s in ( like dead calm , 1988 ) but he does it really , really well . \nalso worthy of note is kathy bates ( edward scissorhands , 1990 ) as a loud mouthed american . \nfinally , the icing on the \'great things\' cake are the special effects . \ncameron is a whiz with effects ( just watch aliens ( 1988 ) , terminator 2 and true lies , 1994 ) and they are used very well throughout . \nthe sweeps of the ships are awesome , although digital domain , who did the effects , cannot animate human movement too well . \nthe humans seem to move to \'smoothly\' , there\'s just something odd about them . \nyou can tell that they have been animated on a computer . \nof course , the ship sinking scenes are awesome , with bodies flying all over the place , and the scene where the ship splits in half has to be seen to be believed . \ntitanic is one of the only films where effects have reinforced the film . \ntitanic , then , is a wonder of directing , acting and cgi , but not writing and story . \nagain , like most of camerons films , the editing is loose ( cameron edits himself ) , and the film could of come in under three hours with a few more cuts . \ntitanic , then , although not the godfather of movies it could of been , is a wonderful attempt at creating a work of genius . \nenjoyable , scary , and even sad , titanic is a film cinema was invented for , filling the screen with incredible images , and assaulting the ears with awesome sound . \na superb film , but sadly not perfect . \noverall rating= ( \n'
?,'if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film , it was studio 54 , the late steve rubell\'s infamous new york discotheque , which came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era\'s heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone , all set to a thumping dance beat . \nso when miramax started production on _54_ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first-timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , and mike myers in his dramatic debut ) . \nmy , how easily does the worm turn . \nhype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher ) unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics . \nat the last minute , though , miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers\'s last name was misspelled on the invitation , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed , myself included . \nand with good reason--somehow , some way , the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism . . . \nboring . \nalthough christopher has distanced himself from the finished film , he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_\'s lifelessness . \n_54_ focuses , for the most part , on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club : coat check girl/aspiring disco diva anita ( a wasted hayek ) ; her busboy husband , greg ( breckin meyer ) ; and , most prominently , the fresh-from-jersey shane o\'shea ( phillippe ) , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender . \nthese characters are about as generic as those descriptions . \nin focusing on the hired help , christopher really missed the boat . \nwith the exception of the flamboyant , always-woozy rubell ( myers , in a well-modulated turn ) , the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers\' but those of the people who went there to party ; not necessarily the numerous vip guests , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club\'s famously hard-ass doormen and dance ( among other things ) the night away with the rich , famous , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow\'s feisty dottie , a disco- and drug-crazed granny , but she\'s a peripheral character at best ) . \nas such , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots , there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ . \nwhat is a disco film--especially one about the pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing ? \neven whit stillman\'s _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn\'t so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene . \ndancing isn\'t the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher\'s fault . \nfrom what i\'ve heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54\'s legend . \nbut somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film . \naside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane\'s fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored . \nshane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold . \nthis tacked-on \" romance \" would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience . \nthey fail on both counts . \nultimately , _54_\'s failure comes down to three letters : f-u-n . \nas in , there isn\'t any to be had for the audience . \ntoo much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place . \nanyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively . \nwhen anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn\'t get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film\'s conclusion ( one of the last-minute reshoots ) . \nstrangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying . \nthere is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there--two of them , in fact--but _54_ is not one of them . \nthey\'re on cable tv : a couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 . \nthese two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings-on within it show that there\'s still a great disco movie to be made . \nthe problem is , after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_ , the subject may have run its hollywood course . \n'

\ndid the ship\'s computer learn something about humanity ? \nwhat was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him ? \nand just what does the film\'s title signify , if anything ? \nas far as i can tell , it refers to a very small plot detail that isn\'t developed , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements . \ncharacter relationships in this film also make very little sense . \nfor some reason , every person in this film keeps having sex . \nwe get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes . \nbassett and spader\'s characters start off hating each other . \nfifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later , they\'re engaging in some hanky-panky . \nwhen troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship , of course both female crew members will fall in love with him . \nevery single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly , which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut . \nthe most prominent example , however , may be the fact that when the film starts , there are no opening credits ! \nfurthermore , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits . \nmaybe that\'s why the film\'s title is mentioned twice during the end credits , right between james spader and robert forster . \nright after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you\'re seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery ) , you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene , with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or situations . \nthe rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes ( you know , where they explain things ) and just went from point a to point b . point a : danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby . \npoint b : tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing . \ndoesn\'t make sense . \nsince i didn\'t understand anything about these characters\' motivations , did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one-by-one ( and he does , knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes ) ? \nnot a whit . \nit\'s a shame , because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do . \nthey don\'t find it . \nbassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces . \nsexual tension ? \nmore like constipation . \nmaybe they\'re just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as \" this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice . \" \nnot that we ever find out who that is , mind you . \nthe climax of their relationship ( taking place in a transport pod ) is probably the film\'s biggest forehead-slapper . \nas troy , peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected . \nhe\' s awfully one-note , but it\'s not as if he\'s given any more notes to work with . \nthe rest of the cast does even less . \ntunney stands around looking cute , then scared . \nphillips broods . \ncruz flirts with the computer . \nthen they all die and a star blows up or something , but i really wasn\'t paying much attention by then . \n \" supernova \" is pretty awful , but i\'m cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got . \nthat\'s it . \nif you expect it to be good ( for whatever reasons you may have ) , you\'ll probably hate it more than i will . \neven the special effects are fairly unimpressive , nothing you haven\' t seen before , and suffice to say the script isn\'t going to save the film . \nhonestly , though , what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym ? \nit usually results in a bad movie , and that\'s what \" supernova \" is . \n'
?,'the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits . \nthe rationale is sound , but in many cases of this and recent years , the sequel is a shoddy product that\'s exposed for the cash-milking vehicle it really is . \nlast year\'s speed 2 and scream 2 , as well as this year\'s species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory . \nin some cases , a sequel can even discredit its predecessor , as with the latest neo-slasher flick , i still know what you did last summer . \nwhatever uniqueness the original might\'ve had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller . \njulie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) and ray bronson ( freddie prinze jr . ) are back from the original to star in i still know , reprising their roles in typical fashion . \njulie and ray experience a rather predictable falling-out at the beginning of the movie , leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson ( matthew settle ) . \nwill and julie hit it off , and along with friends karla ( brandy norwood ) and tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , the foursome heads off to a radio station-giveaway vacation in the tropics . \nunfortunately , things aren\'t so peachy once they arrive , and with a regularity you could set your watch by , the infamous fisherman ( muse watson ) is back with his hook . \nit\'s another bloody showdown , complete with cliffhanger ending . \nthere\'s not much that\'s original about i still know , and with the market saturated by gen-x thrillers like this one , it\'s unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel . \nfor die-hard fans of the genre , this will be required viewing material , but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original i know what you did last summer . \nthe aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isn\'t heightened by skillful scripting or camera work , but rather a tense , string-based score and manipulative editing . \nthe man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue -- he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments . \nmuch of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point . \nthe whole reason the plot exists - julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station - is a dead giveaway , lessening suspense and creating a hurry-up-and-wait timing problem . \nand , whereas the killer\'s identity might\'ve been a question in the first movie , it\'s almost a given here , which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically . \nthree or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as \" the killer . \" \nthey\'re almost used to it , and the performances show it - not hewitt , nor prinze , nor brandy , nor phifer give a decent show . \nand so , in the end , it\'s left wide open for a third movie and - most likely - a brand new supporting cast . \ngod help us . \n'
?,'in arguably the most anticipated movie this century , george lucas has achieved a very mixed reaction to a sure blockbuster . \ndespite the fact the script and plot is a bit of a let down , the entire movie on the whole can be considered a milestone in technical excellence , in the sound and special effects department . \nin terms of characters , by far the most outstanding and interesting is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , whose mature performance far exceeds her tender 14 years of age . \nshe is one ? hot\' babe who defines true ? woman leadership\' . \nshe not only has a presence , but knows how to take command of the situation and save her planet from ruination . \nno thanks to the jedi knights who although led by the force , lack leadership qualities in terms of thinking up a plan to do anything . \nthe young obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) who has a bad hair day in every scene , gets to kill a bad guy in the end , but lacks a love interest to make him a desirable sort of hero . \nin fact all the jedi knight are a bit asexual - there must be something about the force which makes them all hermits and loners . \ni mean it would be interesting to see yoda\'s girlfriend for a change , if he has one . \nnot much better is qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) who mostly broods , and has a better hair do than obi-wan , but only to find the young anakin skywalker and make the biggest mistake of his life . \nalso fascinating is george lucas ? metoclorian\' theory , which claims that micro-organisms live within our cells and tie us to the fabric of the universe . \nand it is the high concentrations of these organisms in an individual which make them particularly powerful in the force . \nmore humerous are the claims to the immaculate conception of darth vader , no doubt a concept stolen from the christian faith , except there will be no christmas to celebrate the birth of this dark emissary of the force . \noverall an experience which is not to be missed because of the very fact that it\'s predecessor almost command a viewing of this inferior successor . \nby all means not the pinnacle of the star wars phenomena but an adequate addition to the clan . \nwatch out for the next one , it should be one steamy encounter between queen amidala and anakin skywalker - who i believe should be portrayed by ? leonardo di caprio . \n'

\nwell , there we go ! \" \nof course , there\'s gotta be romance somewhere along the line , so jane ( minnie driver ) gets introduced about halfway through . \ntogether with her father dr . porter ( nigel hawthorne ) and the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa . \nshe discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately , and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory \" you tarzan , me jane \" scene . \nthankfully , those aren\'t the exact words . \nhowever , i found it distracting that tarzan is going \" ohh ohh ee ee \" one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction . \nhow does he tell his name to another ape ? \n \" ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? \" \nwell , regardless of my picky nature , the romance actually works as only disney romance can : purely contrived , but for some reason rather believable . \nbut hey , tarzan\'s a young adult . \ndo you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane ? \nisn\'t that illegal in most countries ? \noh , well . \ni don\'t think disney will be using my quote anymore . \ntarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical . \nthere\'s lots of music to be sure , but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time . \nwe instead get more of a phil collins concert , as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material . \nthis isn\'t really a bad thing , as the songs are very high-energy and catchy ( i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day ) ; it\'s just different . \ndo yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system , because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie . \nwith each new feature , disney animation gets even better . \nnot necessarily by leaps and bounds , but since they put out a new film each year , a steady rate of improvement is apparent , and this definitely shows in tarzan . \nthere are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3-d effect , and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying . \nthe way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers , and had me thinking this isn\'t just tarzan , it\'s \" extreme tarzan . \" \nhowever , tarzan does not seem to have what i call its \" chandelier scene , \" which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort , utilizing a computer-assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking . \nlasting but a few seconds at most , it\'s been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast , in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail . \nas usual , the voice talent is up to snuff , convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters . \nthe one poor choice in casting , however , was rosie o\'donnell . \ngoing into the film , i didn\'t know she was even a part of it , but when terk started talking , i recognized her voice immediately . \nher performance was fine , but through the rest of the film i kept thinking , \" that\'s no boy ape , that rosie o\'donnell . \" \ndistracting to say the least . \ni\'ll admit i\'ve never read the edgar rice burroughs story \" tarzan of the apes , \" so i couldn\'t tell you how true this film stays to the book . \nbut unless you\'re a purist , you should have few objections to this film . \nwith solid performances , action , adventure , a bit of romance , and great music and animation , tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us . \nnote : when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago , i went off on the promotional and merchandising tie-ins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature . \nthis time , i\'ll just say that i went to mcdonald\'s yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry , and tarzan was on the cup . \n\'nuff said . \n'
?,'according to hollywood movies made in last few decades , life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being . \neven worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god-forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience . \non the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view . \nthis film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life . \nthe film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense . \ninstead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters . \nalthough many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14-year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini\'s fascist regime . \namarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don\'t like federico fellini\'s work very much . \nevery member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible . \ndistortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word \" amarcord \" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase \" i remember \" in local italian dialect . \nin the same way the word is distorted , so is the past in memories of those who remember it . \nafter the premiere , fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film , but it doesn\'t matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini\'s childhood or not ; any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film . \nfellini\'s views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film . \neven the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images . \ncharacters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta\'s sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions . \nevery now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie\'s characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters\' visions . \nbecause of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life . \neven the fascism gets fellinian make-over - fellini views mussolini\'s totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy . \nwhen fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour . \nunlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn\'t care that much about politics . \nlack of self-righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini\'s humanistic approach to his characters . \neach of them , regardless of age , gender , social class or physical appearance , is given opportunity to express his or her views , dreams and fears . \nfellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection , even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people . \nbecause of this warmth and democratic spirit , amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century , and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable , melancholic and even tragic moments . \nfellini couldn\'t produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie . \nvignettes aren\'t memorable because of the characters only ; fellini uses camera , painting film in bright colours , especially in the scenes that depict character\'s fantasies . \nfellini also knows how to use locations , whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel , bright-coloured beach or rural countryside . \neven the down-to-earth streets of rimini , where everyone knows everyone , gets magical dimension during the snowfall . \non the other hand , lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene . \nthis atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini\'s long-time associate nino rota . \nhis amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable , most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced . \nthat music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art . \n'

?,'alexander dumas\' the three musketeers is one of the most often-adapted literary works , and for good reason : the swashbuckler is a legend rather than just a story . \nperhaps the musketeer , a new film that \" reimagines \" the novel in the spirit and style of the matrix , is one adaptation too many . \nit\'s just awful : spiritless , silly and unforgivably boring , transforming the timeless classic into a mish-mash of old-as-time clich ? s and incoherent , repetitive action sequences . \nthis time , d\'artagnan is played by calvin klein model justin chambers , who can\'t even pronounce his character\'s name . \nas a boy , he watched his father get killed by febre ( tim roth ) , a lackey of power-hungry cardinal richelieu . \nhe vowed to have vengeance . \nafter undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman , he goes looking for his enemy . \non his quest , he embroils himself in a struggle for control at the highest levels of the french government . \nthe royal musketeers have lost their gusto , what with their jobs being taken over by the cardinal\'s own guards . \nonly a few loyal swashbuckers remain , among them athos and portos ( who are only figureheads in this movie ) . \ntogether with d\'artagnan , they fight to extricate the queen ( catherine deneuve ) from the traps that febre and richelieu are trying to plant . \noh , and as an afterthought , d\'artagnan falls in love with the poor maid at the local inn ( mena suvari ) . \njust thought i\'d mention that . \nnow , look : i don\'t know whose idea this was , but whoever is responsible deserves a severe tongue-lashing . \ni have nothing against \" modernizing \" classic works of literature - at the very least , they can inspire viewers to actually read the book - but films as dull as this have no positive side effects . \ndirector peter hyams , known for such masterpieces of modern cinema as timecop and end of days , has jettisoned everything that was great about dumas\' masterwork : the sense of excitement , cause , and camaraderie . \ninstead , we get impressively choreographed but somehow vacuous , uninvolving action sequences that emerge from emptiness and lead to nothing . \nwhen the musketeers finally get to holler \" all for one , and one for all , \" i could have sworn that was dumas rolling in his grave that i felt . \nmaybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here is the hyams\'s tone , which is unreasonably dark and brooding when you consider the reader\'s digest condensed version of the story that he gives us . \nit\'s as though anything that may have been construed as \" fun \" was purposely expunged from the production . \nthe joylessness of the proceedings , from the oppressively shady lighting to the mechanical fight scenes , can be felt in every frame . \nchambers can\'t act ; suvari , roth and deneuve can , but aren\'t given the chance . \nand when push comes to shove , the use of stunt doubles is distractingly obvious , though at least roth gets to play a villain without having to wear an ape suit . \nsome movies seem sloppy and careless , clearly made for a quick buck . \nwith the musketeer we get the sense that it was meticulously crafted to be awful . \nthe film is intricate , stylish and precise , hitting the wrong note every single time . \n'
?,'since their film debut in 1984 with the tightly wrought texas thriller \" blood simple , \" joel and ethan coen have been one of the most eclectic , original , and downright fascinating creative teams in modern hollywood . \ntheir films are highly stylized , deeply embedded in a particular time and place , and their characters are more often than not everyday people who get caught up in highly unusual circumstances . \nin \" the big lebowski , \" their first cinematic offering since the multiple academy award-winning \" fargo , \" the action takes place in los angeles during the gulf war , and the hero of the story is jeff lebowski , aka the dude . \nthe dude is played by jeff bridges -- one of hollywood\'s most underrated actors -- in the best stoned performance since sean penn stumbled through the halls of ridgemont high . \nthe dude is a simple man who has never quite made it out of the sixties . \nhe has shaggy , shoulder-length hair , a grizzled goatee badly in need of a trim , and he wears mostly stained tee-shirts , long shorts , and gellies without socks . \nhe smokes a lot of pot , drinks a lot of white russians , and is more than content to spend the majority of his time bowling with his two buddies , a slightly psychotic vietnam vet named walter sobchak ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) , one of those guys who always wants to be part of the conversation , but never quite makes it in . \none day , the dude is confused with another jeff lebowski ( david huddleston ) , this one being a millionaire philanthropist whose trophy wife , bunny ( tara reid ) , owes a lot of people a lot of money . \nthe main plot and all its accompanying side-plots and coenesque diatribes are far too complicated to get into here . \nsuffice to say that the dude becomes deeply involved with the big lebowski when bunny is kidnaped and the dude is asked to be a courier for the ransom money . \nby the time all is said and done , walter has become deeply involved , as has the big lebowski\'s daughter , maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist performance artist , a pornographer named jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) , and a group of german nihilists led by peter stormare , who was so great as the silent but deadly kidnaper in \" fargo . \" \n \" the big lebowski \" plays like an amalgam of all the coen brothers\' earlier efforts . \nit shares their previous films\' strong sense of time and place , as well as their send-ups of movie genres and political and cultural ideologies . \n \" lebowski \" has the same kind of crazed caricatures that made \" raising arizona \" such a hoot ; it has surrealistic dream sequences ( one of which involves a busby berkley-like dance number ) that characterized the ending of \" barton fink \" ; and it has the same kind of cartoonish look and feel that pervaded \" the hudsucker proxy . \" \nthe film was shot by veteran cinematographer roger deakins , who has worked with the coens on three other films , \" barton fink , \" \" the hudsucker proxy , \" and \" fargo . \" \ndeakins always gives the coens\' films a distinctive visual style , and here he does a brilliant job of capturing the bright colors of seedy los angeles in the early nineties , whether that by the obnoxious blue bowling suit worn by the dude\'s main competitor jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , or the strikingly manic dream sequences , one of which involves the dizzy spectacle of watching a strike from a bowling ball\'s point of view . \nif \" fargo \" was the coen brothers\' most restrained effort in years , \" the big lebowski \" marks their return to over-the-edge filmmaking . \nit is overflowing with style and attitude , which helps make up for the scattered plot fragments that never quite come together in the end . \nthe coens fill the screen with lighting , set design , music , and hilarious performances from all the leads , especially bridges and the always reliable john goodman , who shows real comic timing in his untimely \'nam-inspired outbursts and his intense dedication to his adopted judaism . \nwith joel directing , ethan producing , and both writing , the coen brothers seem limitless in their capacity to turn our world inside out . \ntheir talent lies not in their ability to reflect the norms of reality , but in their potential to dig out the darkest corners of life and bring them to light . \nthe coens rejoice in the oddballs of the world , and they put them center-stage to show that it\'s not just guys like the dude who are nuts , but the entire planet . \n'

?,'carry on at your convenience is all about the goings-on in the factory of a toilet manufacturer , wc boggs ( kenneth williams ) . \nonce they have won an order to manufacture 1000 bidets in two months and charles coote ( charles hawtrey ) has designed a suitable model , the factory employees set to work but are interrupted by union representative vic spanner ( kenneth cope ) and friend bernie hulke ( bernard bresslaw ) who call them out on strikes on the slightest pretext . \nmeanwhile , chief foreman sid plummer ( sid james ) is growing tired of his wife beattie ( hattie jacques ) and her budgie . \nhe would much rather live next door with fellow boggs worker chloe moore ( joan sims ) but once he discovers that the budgie can predict the winners of horse races , he is over the moon and flush with money . \nhis daughter , myrtle plummer ( jacki piper ) , is going out with wc\'s son lewis boggs ( richard o\'callaghan ) and this causes conflict on the staff day out to the seaside when vic spanner vies for her attentions . \nin the end , if the strike does not cease , boggs will have to close down his factory , but the support of a group of women led by coote\'s wife-to-be and spanner\'s mother , agatha spanner ( renee houston ) , try to resolve the situation . \nalso , sid realises that his budgie has caused him nothing but trouble since it started predicting horse race winners . \nthere are some good performances , as usual , from sid james and kenneth williams in their standard roles . \ncharles hawtrey is third billing but only appears in a few scenes . \nhis part is mildly amusing . \nrichard o\'callaghan is appealing as bogg\'s stuck-up son , patsy rowlands is funny as miss withering , bogg\'s assistant , and renee houston is terrific in her small part as agatha . \nhowever , sole acting honours go to hattie jacques as beattie plummer . \nalthough her character is not directly involved with the main storyline , she manages to input a great deal of pathos and feeling into her character . \na marvellous performance from a marvellous actress . \nthe film suffers from annoying performances by bernard bresslaw and especially kenneth cope . \nin his carry on debut , cope overdoes his role as spanner making him so annoying as to be unfunny . \njoan sims returns as the love interest ( instead of barbara windsor ) . \nsims\' \'usual\' part as the downtrodden wife was taken by hattie jacques . \nadditionally , bill maynard as fred moore is very poor . \nthis carry on movie tries it best to entertain the viewer : - the locations and wealth of characters are appealing . \nhowever , the toilet humour becomes tiresome very quickly and some of the performances leave a lot to be desired . \nthis movie does not know where it is going . \nit was made in 1971 and talbot rothwell the scriptwriter seems to be in two minds whether to go for \'bluer\' jokes or to maintain the \'innocent\' jokes success of most of its predecessors . \nthat is why this film suffers . \na minor carry on film whose major asset is the performance by hattie jacques . \nthe new \'minor-regulars\' such as o\'callaghan and piper are not able to enliven the movie and the toilet humour becomes humourless after a while . \n'
?,'the tagline for this film is : \" some houses are just born bad \" . \nso i didn\'t expect too much from this . \nbut i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre . \ni thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont . \ni thought , mabe it will be fun ? \nand in fact the beginning was rather intriguing . \nbut by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ? . \nthese great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality . \nhere is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation . \namong them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor ) . \nactually , the doctor is researching the \" primordial fear reaction \" and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch ! \nwhat happens . \nbut he gets unexpected help from the house itself . \nit rumbles , hums and belches forth remarkable sights . \nportals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs . \na fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth . \nfilmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains . \nbut the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen . \nthe second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture . \nis that exciting or what ? \nthe worst thing about it is that it didn\'t have to be bad . \nit\'s based on a great book , ``the haunting of hill house , \'\' by shirley jackson . \na 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent . \nit played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience . \n \" the blair witch project \" , that cost less than an old car , managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses . \nand with a $70 mill . \nbudget , de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror . \nde ! \nbont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is , in itself , frightening . \nhe is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush . \nbut why give him a more serious material ? \nin the end \" haunting \" will only haunt its fledgling studio ( dream works skg ) and de bont\'s career as a director . \nyet it wouldn\'t be fair to say that everything is bad . \nthe effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful , mysterious , magical and spooky . \nbut this is where the good things end . \nthe music is blaring , the floors moving , the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming -- and all of this , every second , every moment of screen time , is absolutely without life . \nit\'s nothing more than a special effects-extravaganza ; visually impressive , but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn\'t engage . \nat first you do not know what\'s going on . \nis this part of the experiment ? \nare these hallucinations ? \nprojections of the subconscience ? \nparanoia ? \nbut in the end it shows out that this is actually happening . \nthe house is actually possessed . \nit is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window . \nfor ever , i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that\'s what i got ? \ni believe hichock once said that \" it\'s ! \nbetter to wait for a climax , than to see one \" . \nthis may be true , and it might actually work , but there is only one problem -- jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary , only stupid . \nthey are impossible to take seriously . \nany paralells that you might have heard before , linking this picture to kubrick\'s \" the shining \" , are absolutely baseless . \n \" shining \" had class , style , story , acting , but most of all talent and originality . \n \" haunting \" has only special effects and art direction to boast of . \nand those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film . \ncasting good actors for small , pale parts only makes things worse . \nbut i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write , most of you will see this film anyway , even if the tagline would say : \" some films are just born stupid \" . \n'
?,'clue is an unfairly ignored comedy , very similar to 1976\'s murder by death . \nthis big screen version of the classic board game ( what\'s next . . . \nchutes and ladders : the motion picture ? ) is filled with slapstick antics and silly dialogue . \nthe plot , for what it\'s worth , has all the characters from the game ( in this case , the names from the game are used as aliases ) meeting in an isolated mansion to confront mr . boddy ( lee ving ) , the man who\'s been blackmailing them all . \nwhen he turns up dead , everyone ( including the audience ) must figure out whodunnit . . . \nand in what room , and with what object . \nwhile not as witty as neil simon\'s murder by death , clue definitely has it moments . \nit has so many moments in fact that i use a lot of the lines from the film when i\'m joking around with my friends . \nto this day , whenever someone says the phrase \" well , to make a long story short \" i have the follow up phrase \" too late \" ready to go . \nthe cast ( all very good comedic talents ) play well off one another , while the late madeline kahn ( as the dark and sultry mrs . white ) sometimes steals the film away from the rest . \nand colleen camp , as the french maid yvette , displays some of her natural talents as well . \nclue is available on dvd from paramount home video . \nit includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) and features the original theatrical trailer . \na french language audio track is also available . \nthe trailer holds up well considering most previews from that time do not , and it even includes a scene not in the film itself ( a scene that should have been in the film , as it\'s a good joke ) . \nalso , the trailer is scored to the music from airplane ! , which was an interesting choice . \nwhen clue played in theaters , it ran with the gimmick of three different endings . \nif you wanted to see all three , you had to go to the movies three separate times . \nso when the film was released on home video , rather than releasing three separate videos , all three endings were included on one tape . . . \nthe first two endings being \" what if ? \" \nendings and the third ending being the actual ending . \nnow for the dvd release you get two choices . \nyou can watch the film as it was presented on home video or you can select to watch it with one of the three endings randomly chosen for you . \n ( note : there\'s an easter egg hidden in the disc pertaining to this . \nafter watching the film with a randomly selected ending , when you return to the menu screen you will be able to highlight the large magnifying glass and select it . \nwhen you do , a secret menu opens , allowing you to watch any of the three endings by themselves . ) \nnow while i applaud the effort of paramount here , as they clearly tried to do something special with the disc , it just doesn\'t work well . \nfirst , why not give the viewer the choice of what ending we want to watch ? \nmaybe someone like myself who\'s seen the movie hundreds of times would like to sit down and show it to someone with the second ending only . \ni\'m no technical dvd expert , but i can\'t imagine that being too hard to accomplish . \nsecondly , the delay between when the film itself ends and one of the endings begins is too long and too obvious , thereby becoming a distraction right when you definitely don\'t need a distraction . \nfinally , the back of the dvd case states \" and now , with this special dvd version , you can see all 3 surprise endings \" . \ni have no idea why they would word it that way , since that\'s not a special feature in the slightest . \nthe video has been out for fifteen years now ( good lord , has it been that long ? ) and it\'s played on television with all three endings all the time . \nthese are merely minor complaints however , seeing that i\'ve watched the home video version hundreds of times and have no problem watching the film as such on the dvd . \nthe picture and sound are wonderfully improved over my worn out vhs copy , and i\'m thrilled that paramount agrees with me that clue is a film worthy of being preserved on this great digital format . \n[pg] \n'
?,'i find most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my set , unless i\'m watching a movie . \ni don\'t even have cable , so i went to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching \" the x-files \" every sunday night . \nit\'s the only show that\'s worth an hour of my time each week ( though , since i don\'t watch reruns , i\'m glad that i have six months of the year to avoid television altogether ) . \ni am an avid fan of the show , and have been for about three years now . \nand i love gillian anderson . \nthe x-files is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off . \nthe film is like a two-hour episode , except that there are a lot more special effects , the plot is thicker , and the resolution is more satisfying . \nthis is a terrific film , both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it ( i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment ) . \ni expected to like it more than any episode i\'ve seen , and my expectations were met . \nactually , the film takes a few risks in its story and plot devices , but , thankfully , the makers managed to do it right . \nwhen the finale ended , the fbi branch known as the x-files had been destroyed , and our heroes , mulder ( david duchovny ) and scully ( gillian anderson ) were left stripped of five years of hard work . \nthe film picks up soon after ; and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building . \nbut wait , i\'m getting ahead of myself . \nthe film actually opens in the ice age , about 32 , 000 years prior , during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien . \nthe alien\'s blood infects them ( fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer ) , and the story jumps into modern times , during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer . \nit turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy , and mulder and scully uncover the cover-up despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi . \nsoon , they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens . \nas i\'ve written before , it\'s not easy to write plot summaries for films like this , because everything needs to be a surprise . \nfans of the show will know what to expect , and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film . \ndirector rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen , making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television . \nthere are some truly suspenseful and well-created scenes here ( late in the film , when they\'re in the alien spacecraft , you\'ll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema ) . \nthe special effects are very good , and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic . \nwhat i find interesting is that the x-files is actually a great way for series neophytes to get into the story . \nour heroes are given subtle introductions ( we\'re not expected to know them on the outset ) , and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isn\'t required to understand the film . \nthere are , of course , little elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans , but i\'ll keep those as surprises . \nit takes a lot of thought and understanding of the series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides , and then create a coherent film that anyone can understand clearly . \nthe series is strong for a lot of reasons . \nit\'s original ( though it has many ties to \" the twilight zone \" and owes some homage to hitchcock ) , and impressively eerie for a television show . \nwhat really makes the series shine , however , are the actors . \nduchovny has so much presence , and is just a fun guy to watch . \nhe has that confidence that will someday make him into a bankable leading man . \nanderson is equally good , and paralyzingly beautiful ; she\'s also a strong actress . \nboth performers have acted in little more than their series , however , though i think they\'ll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon . \ni enthusiastically recommend the x-files , both for fans and non-fans . \n1998 is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters , and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry . \nit\'s an intelligent film , and takes you places that you might not have been ( or , at least , might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar ) . \nthe x-files is impressive in concept , as well : fans of the series are likely to be highly critical , and to take the premise beyond the series is a risky move . \nit\'s nice to see a risk pay off for a change . \nactually , it\'s nice to see a risk at all . \n'
?,'let me begin by saying that this is easily the worst movie in the entire official ( and even unofficial ) james bond series . \nit is so full of self-parody and silly characters that you would almost believe you were watching a spoof . \nan omen of what is to come is provided by the pre-credits sequence , a dull affair featuring a confrontation between a man ( it\'s difficult to give a better description since no mention of him is made elsewhere in the movie ) and the assassin of the title . \na song with woefully terrible lyrics follows , and the rest of the movie is even worse . \nthe plot might have been a pleasant change from the usual rule-the-world so often found in the james bond movies of the 70s , but here we get a confused mismash about a fabled assassin , francisco scaramanga ( christopher lee , putting in a performance which is one of the rare saving graces of this movie ) who someone has apparently payed one million dollars to in order to remove roger moore\'s 007 . \nthere is also a flimsy connection with the energy crisis and a missing solar cell with 95\% efficiency . \nit\'s as much of a mess as it sounds . \nbond is \" helped \" in his task by mary goodnight ( ekland ) , whose character couldn\'t possibly be any closer to the stereotypical bimbo . \nduring the course of the movie she gets locked in both a closet and a car trunk , blunders around a control room accidentally setting off a laser and serves no purpose in enhancing the plot whatsoever . \nmaud adams ( later to star in octopussy ) is a much more stronger and useful character , but she hardly features in the movie . \nscaramanga\'s lackey is a dwarf called nik-nak , who rather fittingly is also possibly the silliest henchman in the series , serving up annoyance and weak dialogue in equal measures . \nworse still is an almost total lack of action throughout the whole movie . \nthere is but one fight sequence about fifteen minutes in ( not counting a ludicrous scene where two teenage girls beat up several dozen trained martial artists -- another misguided attempt at humour ) . \nthe solitary car chase might have been a highlight , but the \" action \" is interrupted on a frequent basis by a redneck sheriff ( j . w . \npepper , played by clifton james of live and let die \" fame \" ) yelling stupid comments out of the passenger window . \nhe is easily the most irritating character in a james bond movie . \neven his presence could have been made bearable by one of the most impressive car stunts in cinematic history , a 360 degree twisting loop jump over a broken bridge -- could have been , except somebody got the idea to dub a mocking whistle tone over the final print . \non top of that debacle , the whole end of the film is an anticlimatic sequence in scaramanga\'s \" funhouse \" . \nthe only good thing that came out of this movie was that the producers had to make the next film in the series ( the infinitely superior \" the spy who loved me \" ) a great film in order for the bond franchise to survive . \n'
?,'wolfgang petersen\'s latest , the perfect storm , is like a pineapple . \nit only tastes good after arduous peeling and digging - if you try to eat the fruit , spikes and all , it\'s going to hurt ? quite a bit . \nok , maybe that was a confusing analogy , so here\'s my main complaint about the latest man battles nature flick : there isn\'t really much of a story to tell . \nbasically , a massachusetts fishing crew goes out to sea on a small boat , called the andrea gail , and gets stuck in the middle of \" the storm of the century . \" \nhow much time does it take for petersen to tell this story ? \nnot nearly enough . \nso he spends the majority of the film developing pointless side stories which all eventually become superfluous . \naudiences want to see the storm , they want to see a fight for survival but what they get is a lot of cliched , maudlin drivel . \nthe last quarter of the perfect storm is utterly perfect in every aspect , but just try lasting the first three-quarters . \ni have yet to read sebastian junger\'s the perfect storm , but from what i have heard it is an unforgettable tale . \nbased on a true story , the book must have found some other way to introduce the characters because in the movie version , the approach is weak . \nusing a wonderfully patriotic score by james horner , petersen almost hides the in-your-face banality . \nright away the central characters are introduced : the gritty , determined captain ( george clooney ) , the ingenue ( mark wahlberg ) torn between his job and his girlfriend ( diane lane ) , the loving father ( john c . reilly ) , the comic relief who\'s always trying to get laid ( john hawkes ) , the new guy ( william fichtner ) who immediately antagonizes a crewmate and the quiet , french guy ( allen payne ) . \nso many problems strike the opening segment of the film that the remaining portions directly suffer . \nit is not the all-star cast\'s fault , just the characters designed for their portrayal . \nallen payne\'s character never speaks in the entire movie , not because he is mute , but because he\'s never given any lines ! \nare we supposed to root for a guy whose face and voice we are never given a chance to interact with ? \nfichtner\'s character is terribly underdeveloped - we don\'t know what he\'s doing there , where he\'s from , or who he\'s supposed to be . \nthe remaining four fishermen are all cardboard stereotypes ( hawkes says to a female stranger in one scene \" you know what would look good on you ? \nme ! \" \nooooh real creative ) . \nas the script advances and the andrea gail floats farther out into the waters , the crew continues to not feel human . \nonly when the storm takes center stage does the movie jump out of its sleepwalk . \nthe computer-generated images of gigantic waves crashing against a helpless boat are thunderously real . \ni can only imagine if this was an imax film , this city kid would surely never go in the water again . \nthis is loud , jolting entertainment - adjectives that completely negate the rest of the film . \nthe perfect storm was unfortunately a disappointment . \nthe maelstrom lived up to its potential but everything else failed to do so . \ni guess i\'ll stick to that other survival spectacle ? you know the one on cbs ? \n'
?,'with the release of gattaca , i began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens , or aliens in general . \nhollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films , but what was usually lacking was a good story . . . \nand good characters . . . \nand good acting , etc ( contact being the exception ) . \nand for some reason , hollywood has never taken a look at the aliens here on earth . \nthe closest , that i have seen anyway , was 2001 : a space odyssey , which made mankind an alien race themselves , being dwarfed by the technology which they created . \nnow comes gattaca , another film about technology reigning supreme , except here on our planet . \nthe difference between 2001 and this one is simple : gattaca is more frightening . \nmost of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering . \nusing this premise , writer/director andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills . \nunfortunately , due to a lack of advertising , i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office . \nsince seeing the film , i have been asking people if they have seen gattaca . \nlately , however , i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca . \nmost people don\'t even realize that it is a film . \ndespite this fact , i surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it . \nniccol\'s film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter , better produced , and more realistic . \ngattaca begins in the 21st century . \nprocreating is now done in a petri dish , and genetic engineering is the normal way of doing it . \nnatural child birth is considered old-fashioned . \nwe are introduced to jerome morrow ( ethan hawke ) , an employee of the gattaca space program . \none of the directors of the program has been murdered , and the main suspect is one vincent freeman . \nthe only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman . \nvincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love . \nhowever , after his birth , and through several genetic tests , doctors tell his parents that he will have a 99\% chance of a weak heart , as well as poor eye sight and a short life span . \nas a result , both parents decide to bring their next baby into the world via genetics . \nanton ( loren dean ) is produced without flaws , and the competition between brothers spawns . \nvincent has a dream to fly a solo-flight around the titan , the 14th moon of saturn , but because of his condition , gattaca , and society in general , forces him to do menial labor around the company . \nlabeled an \" in-valid , \" vincent\'s dream seems impossible , until he meets a black-market dna specialist , german ( tony shalhoub ) . \ngerman introduces him to a \" valid \" who has been paralized from the waste down due to an automobile accident . \njerome morrow ( jude law ) agrees to give vincent all the proper identification tools ( urine , blood , skin and hair samples , etc . ) that he will need to get past gattaca\'s tight security . \nin exchange , vincent will provide jerome with the rent money and friendship . \nafter the murder , however , his dreams are put at risk due to one of vincent\'s eyelashes left at the scene of the crime . \nirene cassini ( uma thurman ) is a genetically flawed \" valid \" working for gattaca , and she begins to fall in love with vincent/jerome . \ngattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen in a long time . \nonly two other intelligent science fiction films have come out in the past two years ( contact and the arrival ) and gattaca will rank among them . \nunfortunately , whenever one intelligent film comes out against special effects-laden films , it normally gets buried . \nthe second best thing about gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs . \nthe orange glow of gattaca\'s scenes are impressive , but the sets deserve most of the credit . \nthe sets are very well done , creating a futuristic sense , but not too futuristic as to alienate viewers . \nas we look at the designs , we realize that these buildings aren\'t too far into the future . \nthis brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible by every passing day . \nthe best thing , however , is the plot . \nthe story is more than your average sci-fi/thriller . \nat its heart , it develops a theme which is never overpowering but is always present . \nperhaps niccol is warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring . \nwould our society become a bunch of soulless zombies ? \nmaybe human nature is a result of mankind\'s flaws . \nif we get rid of flaws , do we get rid of dreams as well ? \nniccol\'s intelligent script handles all these questions extremely well , and the result is an incredibly smart thriller set against a dramatic story , or vice versa . \nthe power of the actors brings a lot of credibility to flat characters . \nwhile flat may sound like a poor job on niccol\'s part , it actually enhances the meaning behind the story . \nethan hawke has developed into a handsome adult actor , giving his best performance of his lifetime so far . \nhis curiosity and motivation pushes his character past all the discouraging remarks from his parents and \" valid \" peers . \numa thurman is . . . well , uma thurman . \nher character is slightly underdeveloped , but the story isn\'t about her . \nhowever , thurman gives a lot of depth to the flat character . \njude law gives the most complex performance of the film with the most disturbingly realistic character . \nhe provides several nice touches , and his final scene is a very touching and heartwrenching one . \nloren dean gives a nice performance in his well-developed character . \ndean is also responsible for some of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie . \nalan arkin portrays one of the detectives with a little less more excitement than with his psychiatrist in grosse pointe blank . \nstill , he does a good job . \ngore vidal and xander berkeley both provide some very good supporting roles , and berkeley also gives a heartfelt discussion towards the end of the film . \ngattaca is rated pg-13 for brief violent images , language , some sexuality , and nudity . \ndespite the somber and desolate mood of the entire film , i wasn\'t exactly prepared for the ending which left me feeling empty . \nit turned me off slightly , but then i realized that everything turned out the way it should have . \nif this had been a typical hollywood film , it would have ended much differently . \nhowever , with all the mindless science fiction films out there , it is nice to have a film which doesn\'t talk down to its audience ( i especially like the ironic title and how it consists of the four letters which make up the genetic coding : g , t , c , and a ) . \ninstead , it provides some much needed entertainment which gives us science fiction fanatics just what we want : a science fiction film with morals behind it . \nwhatever happened to giving the audience a lesson while entertaining ?

?,'studio 54 attracted so many weird and bizarre people to its gates that it\'s a wonder why the film about the life and death of the studio centers itself on one very boring , cliched individual , not to mention an ensemble of people who wouldn\'t be at all fascinating unless they worked at the studio , which they did according to this film . \nare we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly , that a character who is a bland ripoff of tony manero would really make a good protagonist for the film about it ? \n \" 54 \" belongs in the elite group of films known as \" the big disappointments \" : the films that attain so much hype and/or so much potential in its creation that they come off worse than they are when they are finally finished . \ni was heavily awaiting \" 54 , \" not the least because i\'ve become fascinated with the infamous club , which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary that\'s been running all summer on vh1 , which is , weirdly enough , much more intriguing and engrossing than this \" edgy \" film . \nperhaps more importantly , \" 54 \" is part of the blossoming subgenre , \" the 70s nostalgia film , \" which has been picking up mighty steam , what with \" boogie nights \" and \" the last days of disco \" coming out within the year , and both being such damn good movies that not only captured the feel of a certain time period ( the late 70s party and the early 80s wakeup period ) , but brought us interesting and real characters , like scotty , the tragically gay boom mike operator from \" boogie nights , \" and charlotte , the ironically clueless and bitchy co-protagonist from \" the last days of disco , \" not to mention several others . \n \" 54 \" deals not so much with the timeline of the studio ( how it began , how it was run , how it ended ) - that\'s all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale - but more interested in the characters who populated it . \nthis is a definite plus . \nhere\'s a film that could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party , and had to wakeup in the 80s when things like diseases , economy problems , and perhaps worst of all , reagan , all hit and forced everyone into a rude awakening . \nthe story of the studio is tragedy in itself : let\'s look at how it all affected the people . \nbut this film doesn\'t let that happen . \nit gives us a half-assed protagonist named shane o\'shea ( ryan phillippe , from \" i know what you did last summer \" ) , who\'s chief character trait is the fact that he\'s from new jersey , which also happens to be his chief character flaw ( i guess ) . \nhe\'s dim-witted , into being part of \" the scene , \" and soon finds he\'s become a bit of a rave amongst the studio regulars . . . a \nbit like \" saturday night fever , \" \'cept no travolta and no real interest put into him . \npoor , poor phillippe struggles to make him interesting , but all he is a half-assed character and not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been . \nshane begins to hang out with some other denizens of the club , like anita ( salma hayek ) , a wannabe donna sommers , and her young hubby , greg randanzo ( breckin meyer , from \" clueless \" ) , who helps shane become a bartender and rise to a bit of fame . \nalthough he begins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster ( sela ward ) , an exec of sorts , he falls in lust with a soap star named julie black ( neve campbell ) , and thus the boring romance subplot that\'s all too not necessarily important to anything else in the film and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film . \nthe film\'s sole point of interest and one major strongpoint is the all-too necesary personage of steve rubell , played by mike myers ( you heard me ) . \nrubell , the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever , and is an easy metaphor for the life and times of his creation , but the film , thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers , makes him out to be more than that . \nnotice the scenes sole shocking scene , where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion : myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene , and a couple others , that some of us who\'ve only seen him on tv never saw , and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails . \nfirst time feature director mark christopher proves that he\'s a better director than a writer , though not too terribly much . \nhis story is trite and shallow , as are his characters , and his direction is shockingly flat , especially for a film about this subject . \nit\'s as if he had a great story to tell , but instead opted for the easier route . \nthe studio\'s recreation is amazingly accurate , though , and very impressive , but his direction is never captivating enough . \nsome people say that a film does its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in ( despite the film\'s tone , i still want to go to rome and its many nightclubs after i saw fellini\'s \" la dolce vita \" ) , and when i watched \" 54 , \" i didn\'t particularly want to stay . \n'
?,'now , lets first look into the history of shark films . \nthere was the unforgettable jaws . \nthe exciting jaws 2 . the rather flaky jaws 3d and sometime in the late 90s another film of the same genre that i can\'t seem to recall ( about the son of jaws returning to wreak revenge or something like that ) . \nnow , with the magic of cgi , one shark is simply not enough ; in deep blue sea , there are 3 big , mean and really smart ones ! \nrussell frankiln ( jackson ) visits aquatica ( a sea-bound research center ) , where a research is being conducted on the extraction of a hormone substance found uniquely within the shark brain that can cure and reverse the effects of alzheimer\'s disease . \nthe substance is small in quantity and because of this , lead researcher dr . susan macalaester genetically alters the shark dna and grows them twice the size with brains as big as humans , naturally producing more of the much treasured hormones . \nas sure as the sun sets in the west , a shark breaks lose and wreaks havoc within the facility during a hormone extraction procedure . \nwith the flexibility offered by cgi , the sharks get more full-length screen time as their predecessors did in those remote-controlled rubber suit days . \ngone are the days of people getting pulled under the water with the water turning red right after . \nthis time , we get to see the entire gobbling action , with floating limbs and all . \nso-so acting , expected in most of your average action film . \njackson ( fresh from his jedi master role in the phantom menace ) , takes on the dark-side force of a different kind and fits well with his wise-cracking lines . \nll cool j\'s cook role as preacher , does for this film what steven seagal\'s cook could only dream to achieve in his two under siege films . \ndeep blue sea does not offer any of the psychological thrills that jaws has to offer . \nit does however , prove to be a refreshing follow-up within the genre , full of visual thrills , suspense and believe it or not  humour ! \nits like jurassic park under water . \nnothing too stressful , pure entertainment . \nrenny harlin , you are forgiven ( for making cutthroat island ) . \n'
?,'in the past , tim burton has taken cinema by storm with the action packed batman , and the hilarious ed wood , but lately his films just don\'t cut it . \nsleepy hollow has some unique features , but the script is a terrible mess . \nfor those who remember disney\'s fantastic \" adventures of ichabod crane \" , it is actually superior to this . \ndisney\'s version was at least interesting , while burton\'s film drags on far too long , without any suspense or frights . \nwhile the stories are similar , the new version adds too much to the once likable story , and throws in some weak dialogue to top it off . \nichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is now apparently a constable , who was sent to new york to investigate suspicious murders . \nthe victims are headless , and no traces of evidence were found , until the murderer reveals himself , hence the headless horseman . \nnow with the help of christina ricci and an orphaned boy , they must stop the headless horseman from a killing spree , that could destroy the whole town of sleepy hollow . \nsure the headless horseman is an intriguing character , but the story has so many holes that even he nor depp can save this disaster . \nin the original , the headless horseman was meant to be unstoppable . \nno one could stop him , not even ichabod . \nby the end of the film , it had audiences in deep thought . \nburton however concentrates far too much on the atmosphere , and how to make the main characters heroes . \nhe takes no risk what so ever , and this is where he fails . \nanother pathetic element of the film was the script . \nlike i said earlier , he just stuffed too much in at one time , and made it look real sloppy , kind of like the mess the headless horseman made with his victims . \nhe completely butchered the story to pieces . \nthankfully there are a few factors that i particularly liked . \nthe acting by depp was quite notable . \nhe took the nerdy character of the cartoon , and simply acted it out in a better manner . \nif it wasn\'t for his quirky one-liners , i doubt i could have remained awake , because quite frankly i was getting sleepy . \njust when i thought christina ricci was getting to be a good actress , she winds up doing this . \nit just goes to show no actress or actor can pass up a big blockbuster . \nit\'s too tempting to let go , even if the script is mush . \nthe atmosphere too was quite involving . \ni should have just gazed at the sets , and the eerie fog , rather than actually pay attention to what was going on . \nat least burton\'s films are eye candy , even if they are trash . \nthe only real scenes of value were the tree full of heads , and the fight between the horseman , depp and casper van dien . \nother than that , i wish i could just fast forward through all the gaping holes in the film , and just sit back and stare at the scenery . \nby the end , i can only think back and laugh at how bad sleepy hollow developed . \nthis is the biggest disappointment of the year , especially when such a talented director like burton handles a project like this . \ndon\'t waste your time or money , because your head will feel hollow . \n'
?,'this is the best british gangster film since the long good friday . \njon bennet ( played by andrew howard ) is an extremely good assassin . \nas such he is probably an evil man but it does not worry him . \nhe has become an unquestioning weapon . \nhe is in the employ of a kingpin ( david calder ) far more evil than he is . \nbut even assassins have innocent pasts . \nhe runs into an old from school days and he is married to a mutual girl friend from school . \ncomplicating matters is that they live near where he had a recent job and their young daughter may have seen him at the crime . \na big piece of what makes this film work is the depiction of the kingpin . \ncalder is a familiar actor in britain , though not frequently seen in the us . \nhe was seen in the world is not enough . \nhere he creates one of the best screen villains in recent years . \nhe is at once seductive and repellent like a beautiful venomous snake . \nhis lair is underground , apparently in a sewer , where he lives like the king of sewer rats . \nit is the kingpin who pulls the strings that will control bennet\'s life . \npaul sarossy who directs spent most of his career as a cinematographer and like the kingpin\'s lair , he has molded images of class and style out of the darkness . \nby using semi-darkness and letting the colors of deep blue and black dominate every scene he makes the film visually as ominous as anything in this nether world . \nthis is a world that is cold and unfriendly . \nsorossy creates a world of violence much more by what we hear than what we see . \nthis is a film with a great deal of physical violence occurring just out of reach . \nwe see very little but we hear a great deal more and we imagine more than that . \nthe screenplay is by peter waddington based on the novel by neil cross , but it is sarossy\'s film all the way . \nit creates indelible images of evil . \ni rate it an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +3 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n ( i do hope they do not use the tagline \" don\'t mess with mr . in-between . \" ) \n'
?,'i wish more films would take on issues of faith and morality in the modern world . \nand i wish that film-makers would use commandments as a blueprint on how _not_ to do it . \nwriter/director daniel taplitz has created a bizarre conglomeration of satire and soul-searching in this tale of seth warner ( aidan quinn ) , a man of faith who runs into a streak of bad luck which usually inspires country-western lyrics : his pregnant wife drowns , his home is destroyed by a tornado , he loses his job and his dog is crippled by a bolt of lightning . \nconvinced that god has broken his half of the covenant , seth decides to break his , and sets out to turn every \" thou shalt not \" of the ten commandments into a \" thou shalt \" ( and vice versa ) . \nhis wife\'s sister rachel ( \" friends \" \' courteney cox ) wants to help seth ; rachel\'s selfish husband harry ( anthony lapaglia ) , who tends to break a few commandments of his own , thinks seth is a lunatic . \nthus begins a film which picks the wrong tone for every occasion . \ntaplitz isn\'t interested in treating seth\'s tragedies as genuinely tragic , making it impossible to sympathize with him . \ncomposer joseph vitarelli provides a score full of whimsical woodwinds , turning seth\'s sacrilegious mission into an amusing lark ; quinn\'s performance as seth is all wild-eyed fervor without any genuine pain . \nthe actual breaking of the commandments is almost treated as an afterthought , with one through five dispatched in a five-minute montage . \nthe result is a character whose actions feel less like the authentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of a high-concept movie plot . \nit\'s not even entirely clear that commandments is about seth . \ncorporate attorney rachel is given a case which is supposed to soften a hard heart we see no indication she has , while harry gets his comeuppance as part of seth\'s \" false witness . \" \nonly courteney cox strikes a note of reality in a solid performance ; she is sane center around which too equally troubled men revolve . \neven she can\'t force taplitz to decide whose story this is , or what we should have learned about dealing with the struggles in our lives and our relationship with the infinite . \nby the time seth makes a singularly biblical reappearance late in the film , it has become clear that taplitz is aiming for a fantastical fable which makes no connection with real human experience . \ncommandments is a bad comedy which could have been a decent drama if daniel taplitz had had the guts to take faith -- and the loss thereof -- at all seriously . \n'
?,'i remember hearing about this film when it first appeared at cannes over a year ago , picking up the grand jury prize at the festival . \n\'holocaust comedy receives standing ovation\' , the headlines read . \nintrigued by this statement , i looked up information on the film and found that , sure enough , life is beautiful is in fact a comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand years . \neven though the movie was extremely well-received by critics and public alike , i couldn\'t help but be disgusted at this notion ; human tragedy is not something i feel should be celebrated . \nonly now do i see the error of my ways . \nafter finally viewing the film for myself after avoiding it for some time , it became clear that it is not , as the headlines proclaimed , a \" holocaust comedy \" ; on the contrary , life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps . \nrather , it focuses on the relationship between a father and his son , who he is trying desperately to shield from the horrors of their situation . \nroberto benigni ( who also wrote and directed the movie ) stars as guido orefice , a chaplin-inspired clown and all round jolly guy who , as the film opens , is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher ( nicoletta braschi , benigni real life spouse ) . \nthrough the course of the first hour or so , we see guido striving to get the attention of this \" beautiful princess \" , as he calls her . \nemploying the magic of laughter , the italian comedian wins her heart and together , they raise a young boy named giosue ( child actor giorgio cantarini ) . \nlife treats them well until hitler\'s minions rise to power , and the family is whisked away to a german camp , where guido becomes convinced that he must upholds his son\'s innocence no matter what the sacrifice . \ngranted , it contains some uproariously funny moments both in and out of the concentration camp , but it does not pull a \" hogan\'s heros \" and make light of the slaughtering of some six million innocent jews . \nsomehow , it achieves hilarity without disrespecting it\'s gravely serious subject . \nso , we\'ve established that life is beautiful is not a \" holocaust comedy \" . \nbut , there is another complete misrepresentation of this material that really disturbs me . \nthe film , despite critic\'s declarations of it being a \" triumph of the human spirit \" , is no such thing ; not in my eyes , anyway . \nsome have called the story an \" affirmation of the beauty of life \" , but i say it is a very dark and bleak statement about man\'s capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy . \nthe film\'s ending has been recognized as the most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently , but i found it to be truly discerning and upsetting . \nessentially , life is beautiful is quite possibly the greatest hoax in the history of film . \nhowever , i am not denying the movie\'s greatness . \nbelieve me , it\'s fantastic . \ni\'m just saying that i think benigni did something different than what most people are interpreting it as . \nbut perhaps i\'m reading more into the movie than is really there . \nmaybe the film\'s brilliance relies on the idea that the viewer can interpret the meaning of it in any way they see fit . \nin fact , maybe roberto benigni has made a film that is the sole argument for the old saying that you get out of a movie exactly what you put into it . \n'
?,'`the bachelor\' is one of the best terrible movies you will ever see . \nwading through this gooey , detestable sludge is quite the chore for even a dedicated romantic . \nthose hoping to find some genuine charm and feeling behind this chris o\'donnell vehicle should wander elsewhere ; `the bachelor\' is a painfully clumsy mess strung together with a few brief moments of surprising poignancy . \nawaiting these moments by enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money . \nalthough he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical pretty-boy cocoon , chris o\'donnell has an effortless charm as an actor . \nmost will recognize him as the high-flying robin from the two latest `batman\' films , but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile . \ncan o\'donnell carry the weight of a film on his shoulders ? \nperhaps , if he found the proper vehicle . . . \nbut `the bachelor\' falls far short of the requirements . \nthe actor just can\'t register with such a pathetic screenplay as the guiding light to success . \na few instances of adorable humor aside , it becomes apparent that no one could save the festering mess that is `the bachelor\' . \no\'donnell plays jimmie , a hopeless romantic in his late twenties who\'s progressing in a serious relationship with anne ( renee zellweger ) . \njimmie takes anne out for dinner to the restaurant specifically used for proposals , and attempts to ask for her hand in marriage . \nthe problem is that his proposal sucks . \nbig time . \nyou can tell things aren\'t going pleasantly , because jimmie gets the infamous ? deer-in-the-headlights\' look when anne questions his approach . \nand then , the plot ( along with the stupidity of the movie ) thickens . \njimmie\'s grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies suddenly , leaving a video will behind for his grandson ( who also happens to be his only living relative ) . \neverybody is speechless when grandpa declares that he is passing down an inheritance in the amount of 100 million dollars to jimmie . \nof course , there\'s a catch : he must get married before his 30th birthday , stay joined with his bride for an entire decade , and produce healthy children within the first five years . \nthe bad news is that jimmie\'s birthday is the following day . \nwith anne out of town , he must find a willing bride to share his riches with . . . \nand within a very limited time frame . \nthere are certainly a few worthwhile aspects of `the bachelor\' . \nfor one , the movie\'s approach is interesting and not dripping with clich ? . \nanother is the colorful cast . \no\'donnell and zellweger are cute together , and the supporting cast tries relentlessly to rescue the film from drowning in it\'s own mediocrity . \nustinov is enjoyable as the cranky grandfather figure , and james cromwell is sincere and effective as a wise priest dragged through jimmie\'s marital adventures . \nand now the cons : the approach may be interesting , but in trying an old-fashioned method , director gary sinyor gives the film a synthetic feel . \nthe characters are drawn with obvious , broad strokes , and the plot is bogged down with everything humanly imaginable . \nyes , `the bachelor\' is far more frustrating than cute . \nthe screenplay is lamely written , and the subject matter poorly conceived . \nthe considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted , along with whatever promise the film initially contained . \npotential goes out the window early to suit sinyor\'s `colorful\' approach , but not a minute of this hapless drivel seems accustomed to the director\'s wishes . \n`the bachelor\' becomes lost without a homing beacon to save it . \nyou\'ve seen the tv spots , haven\'t you ? \no\'donnell is madly rushing down a deserted street and the caption reads `what is this man running from ? \' \nin actuality , he\'s fleeing from thousands of angry brides who want to marry him and inherit his fortune ( it\'s one of the few enjoyable sequences in the film ) . \nafter seeing the movie , i believe that the approaching horde could be something else . \no\'donnell could be running from his angry fans , who have just endured `the bachelor\' , and are hunting him down for revenge . \n'
?,'topless women talk about their lives falls into that category that i mentioned in the devil\'s advocate : movies that have a brilliant beginning but don\'t know how to end . \nit begins by introducing us to a selection of characters who all know each other . \nthere is liz , who oversleeps and so is running late for her appointment , prue who is getting married , geoff , liz\'s boyfriend , neil , her previous boyfriend , ant who has written a screenplay . \nfor the first hour , we get to know these people through everyday activities , as they talk on the phone , go out to dinner , hang clothes on the line . \nthe interactions seem so truthful and guileless that it is almost as if the film-makers hid cameras around the place and filmed these people unbeknownst to them . \nat times , the events border on the ridiculous , like the screening of the film , but they still seem in keeping with the characters and their lives . \nthis doesn\'t sound like a brilliant premise for a film - \" we just follow a lot of people around who are vaguely related \" - but it\'s the execution of the idea that makes topless women talk about their lives so engrossing . \nunfortunately this level of honesty isn\'t maintained . \nwith about half an hour to go , a sense of impending doom invades topless women talk about their lives and from there is descends into melodrama . \nsuch a disappointment after such a brilliant start . \nthe actors are all quite good with ms . danielle cormack as liz being particularly impressive . \nthe energy of her character is palpable and is a major reason the movie is so watchable . \na lot of the performances are a bit rough around the edges but this suits totally the documentary feel of the film . \nit seems like these are real people we are watching rather than actors playing roles . \nthat is why the melodramatic turn of events comes as such a shock . \nup till that point , i was transported to this world where these real but mildly insane events were taking place . \nwhile the final half hour is not beyond the realms of possibility , it\'s unlikely in a way that is jarring to someone caught up in the world of the film . \nnot just the events , but also the tone of some of the end is wrong , clashing strongly with the sense of fun that has preceded it . \nthis is not to say that topless women talk about their lives is not a good film . \nas stated above , the first hour is superb and even the end is above average . \nit just takes a turn which means that an otherwise brilliant movie loses some of its gloss . \n'

?,'in the company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because , in a year plagued by brothers mcmullen-style , earnestly shallow gen-x angst pictures , it seemed to be actually about something . \nit angered people , started arguments outside the theater , riled things up . \nit ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise has been a disappointing year for independent film . \nhaving endured my share of the hype , i waited calmly for men to reach the hinterlands wherein i reside , and then checked in to see what all the fuss was about . \ndoes men live up to its press ? \nwell , yes it does . \nand it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office . \nfor the uninitiated , newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard , two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment . \nchad and howard are archetypes , examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business . \nchad is the blond golden boy , genetically engineered for success , the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder . \nhoward is chad\'s boss , but he is weaker of will , the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent . \nwe first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge . \nthere chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain : he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office , woo her simultaneously , win her love , and then dump her . \nthe reason ? \nboth men have recently been dumped themselves , and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex . \n \" it\'ll restore a little dignity to our lives , \" he says . \nhoward , helpless against the force of chad\'s will , agrees to the plan . \nthey quickly spot their prey in the form of christine ( stacy edwards ) , a fragile deaf woman working as a temp . \nchad moves in for the kill , flashing his golden boy smile , plying christine with lunch , then flowers , then dinner . \nhoward follows suit , though his efforts are in contrast ham-handed and desperate . \nflattered to have the attention of two eligible men , christine dates them both . \nyou can guess which one she falls for . \nsoon a tragic lovers\' triangle develops : christine loves chad , chad loves himself , and howard loves christine on the grounds that , since she\'s handicapped and shy , she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him . \nadult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high , does it ? \nin chad , writer/director labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film-hannibal lector may eat human flesh , but chad is an eater of souls . \nhis evil is as subtle as a viper\'s , and as easy as his smile . \nwe watch in stunned disbelief as he back-stabs coworkers , humiliates his subordinates , and works his deadly venom into christine\'s heart . \nhis character would be a joke if he wasn\'t so chillingly real- all of us have worked with a chad , and some of us may be him . \nhe\'s the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness . \nif one of his co-workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns , he had best have his escape route clearly in mind . \npolitics is his game , and the modern cubicle-filled office is his playground . \nmen wears the guise of a black comedy , but it functions best as allegory . \nthe most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company , then forces him to prove it in a manner i won\'t describe . \nthe scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril . \ncould it happen in the real world ? \nprobably not . \ntaken as allegory , however , it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society . \nmaybe it\'s just the english major in me , but chad , in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard , can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism , of greed without conscience . \nthe entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism- only the strong will survive . \nthe marvel of labute\'s multi-layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way . \nbut does the film work as entertainment ? \nits darned funny in spots , particularly in the men\'s room scenes , which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions . \nit works less well as drama , since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers . \nstacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine , and succeeds in making us care for her , but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her . \nlikewise , chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions . \nby the end of the film you\'ll feel as if you\'ve met a genuine monster in chad ; perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film . \ncertainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed . \nbut the picture is often mesmerizing , and the script is a work of fine craftsmanship , which makes it well worth your time . \nlike all good films , it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world . \nwhile watching chad in his moment of triumph , i couldn\'t help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold , merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs . \nthere may be a little bit of chad in all of us , but some of us have taken chad-ness to the level of art . \n'
?,'depending on who you ask , the original sin was either the eating of the apple , the act of disobedience against god , or the act of betrayal . \nbut in case you didn\'t know this , don\'t bother remembering it . . . \nthe words \" original sin \" never come up in the movie of the same name , let alone the concept of it . \nthe closest the film even gets to catholicism is in its narrative ( the story is told by angelina jolie to her priest while on death row in cuba , circa 1900 ) . \nregardless of its senseless title , original sin does actually have a plot ( albeit one of the most mangled acts of screenwriting since the art of war , based on the book waltz across darkness ) . \nboy ( antionio banderas ) places personal ad sometime around 1900 , searching for a wife . \nsince this is a century ago , we narrowly dodge a remake of green card , only to find that the girl ( jolie ) faked her photo and is actually beautiful . \nskipping a few moderately useless sex scenes ( getting the question out of the way , yes , we get to see angelina jolie\'s breasts again ) , the girl turns out to be a con artist , swindles boy for his money , and heads for the hills . \noriginal sin then briefly tries to be a thriller . \nwe see boy go whore-chasing , saying he wants to find girl and kill her . \nbut as soon as boy actually finds girl , instead of following what might have been a promising ( or at least not completely fucking boring ) thriller , the film degenerates into the worst dissection of the virgin/whore complex since milk money . \ngirl toys with the idea of reforming her con-girl past , all the while avoiding the \" other man , \" a lover that keeps making her start these scams in the first place . \nadd insult to injury with some of the worst stylistic choices in cinematic history ( literally half of the film is either in slow motion or uses a strobe effect ) , and acting roughly the caliber of a b . b . gun , and original sin is one of the most torturous films of the summer , definitely front running to make my bottom ten of the year . \ndon\'t even bother with original sin , but if you do go , be honest with yourself and admit its pure sex appeal . \njust keep in mind that although this film may not be the most original on the block , it\'s much worse than a sin . \nthis is sacrilege . \n'
?,'leonardo decaprio ( what\'s eating gilbert grape ) and claire danes ( tv\'s my so called life ) star in director baz luhrmann\'s modernized version of william shakespeare\'s classic , romeo & juliet . \nsurrounded by a superb supporting cast , in-cluding paul sorvino ( goodfellas ) , brian dennehy ( tommy boy ) , pete poslethwaite ( the usual sus-pects ) and john leguizamo ( executive decision ) , decaprio and danes shine throughout the film . \nthe story starts off at a gas station , where the \" montague boys \" meet the \" capulet boys \" and square off with one another . \nsymbolizing the swords of shakespeare\'s day were their weapons , like the \" rapier-9mm \" or the \" longsword- shotgun . \" \ninstead of killing each other right away , they shoot around , just like in sword fights of old . \nanother great thing about the film was the performance of harold perrineau as romeo\'s best friend . \nmercutio , who in shakespeare\'s novel was quite a stud , was portrayed as an afri-can-american cross-dresser whose violent na-ture , was a definite plus . \nmiriam margoyles , a virtually unknown actress was astounding as juliet\'s nurse , even though she was never given a name . \nshe was the only one who could keep juliet out of her fantasy world . \nverona was the home of the rival families in shakespeare\'s version , only slightly changed in luhrmann\'s . \nnow known as verona beach , the capulet\'s ( led by sorvino ) and montague\'s ( led by dennehy ) are now rival corporate dynasties . \nand their small family skirmishes were now huge gang wars . \none slight problem with the film was the difficulty to comprehend the dialogue , since it was spoken in old english . \nsub-titles could have helped in the beginning of the movie , but toward the end , it became easier to understand . \nthis excellent movie poses another prob-lem : what genre is it ? \nromeo & juliet contains so much drama , yet enough comedy and action to be placed in either of those categories . \nwith the same award-winning formula that was used by quentin tarantino in reservoir dogs and pulp fiction , romeo & juliet is a sure fire modern masterpiece . \n , \n'
?,'inspired by the 1958 film house on haunted hill starring vincent price . \ndirected by william malone . \nstarring geoffrey rush , famke janssen , and chris kattan . \nrated r ( contains violence , profanity , and brief nudity ) . \nsynopsis : eccentric millionaire price offers $1 , 000 , 000 to each of his guests who appear at a gathering at a former sanitarium . \nthe only catch is that they have to survive the night at the establishment , an establishment haunted by its former staff and patients . \ncomments : house on haunted hill is based upon the original 1958 film of the same title directed by william castle and starring vincent price . \nin an obvious homage , the millionaire\'s name is price and he sports a thin mustache like price used to have . \nthis is a pretty bad horror film , yet bad horror films sometimes are very entertaining , and house on haunted hill is just such a film . \nit is , surprisingly , better than another recent haunted house remake , the haunting , a film which owes its basis to the classic horror novel by shirley jackson . \nthe haunting had literary pretensions and fell flat on it face . \nhouse on haunted hill owes its lineage to a b-movie 40 years old and makes no illusion that it\'s a crappy horror movie . \nthus , somehow , it proves slightly more successful . \ni can\'t think of another recent film which has had such an eclectic cast . \nit is this cast which lifts this ho-hum thriller into a borderline entertaining exercise in camp horror . \nprice , the main character , is played by geoffrey rush , the academy-award winning actor of shine . \nrush seems to be making a downward spiral in the movie industry , a spiral reminiscent of ben ( ghandi , schindler\'s list ) kingsley\'s ridiculous appearance in the camp sci-fi classic species . \ni don\'t know why , but sometimes it\'s entertaining to see \" quality \" actors in bad movies . \nmore surprises ? \nrising star taye diggs plays a stereotypical african american sports figure ( rather lamely too ) , and singer lisa loeb ( ! ) \nappears as a tv news reporter . \nthe highlight of the cast , however , has to be saturday night live member chris kattan . \nkattan\'s comic sense provides several good humorous moments as he plays the hysterical proprietor of the former sanitarium . \nwhile the first half of the film leaves the audience guessing as to what\'s exactly going on , the second half dissolves into standard ghost story stuff and loses some of its suspense . \na disappointingly cheesy ending really mars this movie too . \nhouse on haunted hill , i suspect , has just about left the second-run theaters . \nit\'s worth catching on cable next year , if you get a chance . \nif you have a choice , pick this movie over the haunting , it\'s the better of two evils , you could say . \nthough , more appropriately perhaps , it\'d be better to say that it\'s the better of two turkeys . \n'
?,'the andromeda strain is the greatest science fiction film ever made . \ni know that is very sweeping statement , so i\'ll qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of \" science fiction , \" stories in which speculative science is at the core of the plot . \n2001 : a space odyssey is probably a better film , but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be a science . \nmost all other films we normally classify as science fiction , or sf , are really just fantasy , action or horror stories set in a futuristic setting . \nthe andromeda strain starts out with two soldiers in a high-tech ( for 1970 ) van looking for a crashed satellite in a tiny new mexico town . \nsomething bad happens to them . \npictures from a reconnaissance plane show a shocking sight . \napparently everyone in the town is dead . \nthe authorities call a \" wildfire alert , \" summoning four scientists , all but one of them somewhat reluctant , to a super-secret underground germ warfare laboratory in nevada . \ntwo of scientists , stone and hall , fly directly to the town in space suits and find a town where almost every single resident literally dropped in their tracks , their blood turned to powder in their veins . \nsome went insane before they died and two of them , a baby and an old wino , are miraculously still alive . \nthey take the survivors and the satellite back to the lab , where stone pressures the white house to call up a \" directive 712 , \" an executive order to cauterize the area around the town with a nuclear bomb . \nwhat they find on the satellite when they get back to the lab is andromeda , an organism that defies all the normal rules of earth-like life and mutates as it grows . \ntheir only hope to cure it is to find out what a perfectly healthy baby boy has in common with an old derelict . \nwhat they find out is that organism feeds directly on energy and that detonating the a-bomb over the town would only spread it across the entire planet . \nthey barely call off the bombing in time . \nbut then the organism mutates into something that threatens to eat through the labs defenses and break out . \nthis triggers the lab\'s last-ditch defense mechanism , an atomic bomb . \nto those raised on the brainless action fare that pollutes movie theaters these days , the andromeda strain will probably seem interminably slow . \nmuch of the film is a lot of people standing around looking at video screens and computer readouts . \nbut what the characters see on those screens ratchets up the tension with every turn of the screw . \nthe performances are universally fine , with the actors keeping things low-key and restrained , just like scientists . \nto me , the real appeal of this film is the fact that it shows scientists acting like scientists and makes it seem exciting . \nwe follow the logic of their deduction step by methodical step , puzzling like they do every time andromeda behaves in a way we don\'t expect . \nthis film is only available on wide screen on dvd and that is the way to see it . \nit was originally rated g when first released but it now carries the pg rating , mostly for very mild nudity and one scene in which a body\'s wrist is slashed , spilling its powdered blood . \n'
?,'alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters . \ni saw it when i was 13 years old , and i must admit that i didn\'t like it . \nof course , i was expecting aliens again , and i believe this was my fault . \nin order to appreciate alien 3 , you need to see aliens , but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor . \njames cameron\'s aliens was an action film , and many people consider it the best in the series . \ni am among that group , but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film , which critics have bashed for its originality . \nmany thought the final chase scene went on for too long , and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action . \nboth are untrue , because the film has quite a bit of action , and the dialogue was essential and well-written . \nas for the chase sequence , it was long , but not overly long , creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion . \nperhaps watching alien 3 on video helped . \non the big screen , i was overwhelmed by something i normally didn\'t see . \nit was a very dark film , and the language was extremely harsh . \ni had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities . \ndon\'t get me wrong--i\'m not saying films should eliminate swearing , but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks , it gets rather distracting . \nhowever , since seeing it again , i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters . \nas a result , alien 3\'s only flaw ( albeit a major one ) is the underdeveloped characters . \nwe never really care about any of them , and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie . \nthere were only two characters i liked , and of course one was lt . ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , although we have gotten to know her through two other films . \nthe other character was dr . clemens ( charles dance ) , but because we like him , the inevitable occurs . \nalien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off . \nthe prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher , who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry . \nwithout using a single line of dialogue ( unless you count computer warnings ) , fincher sets up the entire film . \nan impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card . \nwe see lt . ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments . . . \n ( title ) . . . \na shot of an alien egg . . . \n ( title ) . . . \nalien legs stretch up into the air . . . \n ( title ) . . . \nand so on and so on . \nduring these first ten minutes , i learned everything i had to in order for alien 3 to proceed . \nit\'s quite a remarkable opening , and one which will remain in my mind for a long time . \nbecause of this face-hugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens , the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod , and sent down to the nearest planet : fiorina fury-161 , an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison . \nhowever , the face-hugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryo-tubes , and is sent down with the escape pod . \nunfortunately , during the landing , all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed . \nripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery . \nof course , you need a carrier for this face-hugger , and it attachs itself to the dog which came with the team of inmates . \nripley is revived and asks to see the ship . \nafter seeing a mysterious acid-eaten section , ripley asks to see the dead bodies , and then have them cremated . \nthis cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films . \nfeaturing a monologue from dillon ( charles s . dutton ) , a prisoner who has found god , the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony to the dog\'s demise . \nit\'s one of the most memorable moments , as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog . \nand this is where alien 3 succeeds . \nfincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films , and i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock ( in fact , he is the mixture of both ) . \nfincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it , and i figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films . \nalien 3 is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images . \nby doing so , fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise . \nmany people have criticized fincher\'s filming of the death scene of ripley ( i reveal nothing by saying this ) as looking too fake , but i enjoy and relish in the portrayal . \nshowing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch , but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron , a great deal of symbolism is derived . \ni feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron . \nhowever , most people seem to want to witness ripley die ( which creates a paradox , as she is the character i didn\'t want to see die ) . \nwhy she is killed is one of the surprises of the film , and i don\'t plan on spoiling that in this review . \n>from every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem to stick with you forever . \nin alien , it was , of course , the moment the alien burst out of kane\'s stomach . \nin aliens , it was the showdown between alien and ripley in a machine . \nalien 3 has several , but most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley . \nripley is pushed up against a wall , and the alien stands inches away from her . \nwhy it doesn\'t kill her is a shocker , which later leads to a surprise ending . \nfincher apparently loves to use close-ups of actors\' faces ( michael douglas and the clown face-off in the game in the same style ) , and by shaving off the actors\' hair , the only thing we have to look at is their faces . \nmany critics didn\'t like all the actors being bald , but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot . \nmost of alien 3 works when you take it in context of the story , but when you try to compare it to its predecessors , fincher\'s turn seems a bit gloomy and dark , though that\'s not always a bad thing . \nthe plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films , with some major twists . \nagain , we are setup with several different characters , and one by one , they are picked off . \nhowever , while the first two had tons of arsenal ( especially cameron\'s film ) , alien 3 takes place on a planet devoid of human life except for this run-down prison . \nas a result , no weapons are to be found . \nthis creates a lot of tension , although i must admit that fincher could have added a lot more suspense . \nas an alien film , alien 3 is the worst of the series , but by itself , it is an extremely well-made motion picture , with a lot more merits than not . \nthe unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is the one-dimensional characters . \ni never was really emotionally involved on screen because most of the characters are hardcore criminals whom i really could care less about . \ndespite this , ripley was the central figure , and that\'s what is important . \nwe care for her , even though she began to act just like one of the guys . \nagain , the technical side of this film is remarkable , and better than the two previous versions . \nwhile cameron\'s version was a pumped up action film with massive artillary , fincher uses brilliant camera angles , terrific lighting , and moody sets . \nthe cinematography , by alex thomson , is very well done , with a terrific chase sequence towards the end of the movie . \nthe confusion of the ending draws the viewer in , as we are just as confused as the actors who are being chased around . \nthe yellows , reds , and oranges of the lights create a dark mood , and by themselves create a lot of suspense . \nshadows dance on the walls , and yet those shadows could easily be the alien . \nthe alien is different from its predecessors this time around , and the swiftness of this alien is quite intense . \nthe camera likes to take up the perspective of the alien , racing after the characters . \nthe sets are quite incredible , which are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien . \nthe narrow corridors and labrynthine hallways is well constructed . \nthe sets appear to be in the future , but not too far in the future . \none of the set pieces even aids in the destruction of the alien ( nothing surprising there ) . \nsigourney weaver turns out yet another good performance , equaling her portrayal of ripley in aliens . \nshe was snubbed at the oscars for this one , mainly because the film was a critical bomb . \nher reactions are far more realistic in this film , with her crying over the loss of the little child she risked her life saving in her previous encounter . \nit\'s quite touching really . \ncharles s . dutton is very strong in his performance as one of the inmates , and i was on the brink of actually caring for him . \ncharles dance turns in a nice low-key performance , and as a result , i cared for him immediately . \nlance henriksen makes a brief appearance as bishop ii , but he was more entertaining in aliens . \nthe rest of the cast is pretty stale , though pete postlethwaite sticks out due to his recent turns in the usual suspects and the lost world . \nalien 3 is rated r for strong violence and language , and sex . \nalthough it has its flaws , alien 3 is highly entertaining with rich symbolism . \nthis film reminds you how much fun it is to spot metaphorical images throughout a movie . \nwhile kubrick may have a moral message throughout his films , fincher relies on cinematic devices to bring his meanings out . \nit\'s a film like fincher\'s which reminds us that it is okay for a film to sacrifice quality for quantity ( the final scene ) . \nin fact , it tells us that we , as a society , have become too critical of things which may happen to look a little \" fake . \" \nwhenever something looks fake on screen , we immediately point it out as a mistake . \nbut perhaps it isn\'t a mistake . \n'

?,'to paraphrase a song title from an earlier disney movie , mulan is a whole new world . \nthe mouse factory\'s latest feature is a treasure , featuring magnificent animation , a strong story and finely drawn characters . \nmulan is the story of a fiesty , head-strong young woman who , unlike other disney heroines , isn\'t seeking her prince charming , \nmulan\'s motivations are simple ; to save her father , serve her country and find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say . \nthe story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation . \nthe emperor has called for a conscription , one man from each family to join the army and defend the nation . \nmulan\'s crippled father is called , but mulan sneaks off , steals his armor and takes his place . \nmulan is a saga of courage and self-discovery . \nyet , despite the grim backdrop of war , it is a lively tale of self-reliance and brain-over-brawn that even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy . \nthe movie utilizes a strong corps of asian-american talent as the voices for the main characters , including the wonderful ming-na wen ( the joy luck club ) as mulan , b . d . \nwong as shang , mulan\'s commanding officer and later love interest , pat morita as the emperor and the veteran soon-tek oh as mulan\'s proud , but loving father . \nalso adding to the proceedings is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon , sent by mulan\'s ancestors to watch over and help the young woman . \nhis fast , wise-cracking , hip-talking mushu may seem out of place , but it\'s a crowd pleasing performance , especially for the youngsters . \nthe movie features only a couple of songs , fewer than most previous disney animated flicks , but mulan\'s are winners . \nthe music by matthew wilder and lyrics by david zippel fit nicely into the plot . \nthe overall score by jerry goldsmith also is a plus . \nmulan is a treat , more powerful than hercules , with more heart than the hunchback of notre dame . \nat about 85 minutes , mulan moves rapidly , and will hold the attention of youngsters from beginning to the end . \nmulan will set a new standard by which future animated efforts by disney and other studios will have to work hard to attain . \nalso , it is hoped that the success of mulan , and there is no doubt that it will prove to be a popular vehicle , will spur an interest for more movies with oriential or asian-american themes so as to provide more substantial roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this production . \nit would be nice to see them on screen as well as hear them . \ncommitted to lifelong learning through effective communication \n'
?,'the summer of 00\' wasn\'t a very good one for devout cinephiles . \nit offered no blair witches or sixth senses ; the best big budget hollywood could do was an efficient x-men adaptation and a flawed but entertaining shaft update . \nnurse betty signals the unofficial end of that dreadful summer movie season and the commencement of a potentially brighter fall movie season , that battery-charging ( at least for critics who have to sit through every piece o\' shit that moseys into multiplexes ) time of year when all those oscar contenders ( read : \" quality \" films ) compete for audiences . \nalas betty has the dubious distinction of being the first overpraised junk heap of the new season . \nit\'s also indie director neil labute\'s first attempt at something resembling a mainstream picture , and i\'m sad to report it\'s a resounding failure ( at least on this web site ) , a mess that\'s as hopelessly saccharine as people have accused labute\'s previous films of being unrelentingly masochistic . \ni went in expecting something decent , for betty was gleefully praised , it\'s screenplay even winning an award at cannes , but i exited shaking my noggin in bewilderment . \nare critics so desperate for something unique that they\'re blind to how derivative the particular brand of \" uniqueness \" betty dolls out is ? \nfor the first time labute is working from a script he has not written , and he seems unsure of how to handle the material . \nbetty tries to be hip like pulp fiction ( this is another flick featuring a pair of strangely bright and articulate hit men ) , enchanting like the wizard of oz ( of which this film makes several allusions to ) and heartwarming like [stick in your favorite loveable misfit movie] , but by the end it left me cold with its calculated desperation . \nit\'s labute\'s half hearted attempt to make a crowd pleaser and he doesn\'t even seem to have half that heart in it . \nnurse betty concerns a soap opera addict , betty ( brilliantly played by renee zellweger ) , who witnesses the killing of her husband , del ( aaron eckhart playing the most casually loutish husband since richard benjamin in diary of a mad housewife ) by two hit men ( morgan freeman and chris rock ) . \nshe happens to have her most beloved soap on in the background and somehow merges the two realities . \nshe\'s blocked out her husband\'s death and thinks she\'s a character in her favorite soap , a reason to love . \nbetty sets out on the road to la ( with some drugs unknowingly stashed in her car trunk ) searching for her soap boyfriend dr . david ravell ( greg kinnear ) while the two bickering hit men follow in not so close pursuit . \nthe labute who birthed the extraordinary in the company of men , slipped a bit ( but not much ) with his sophomore effort , your friends and neighbors , then fell straight on his ass with bash , a play he penned that was recently aired on showtime . \nthe play demonstrated no forward movement as an artist , only labute\'s persistence in wallowing in the horrid things \" average \" people do to each other , usually with out realizing how horrid they themselves are . \nin the play , paul rudd , as an obnoxious jock , delivers a monologue detailing how he once followed a gay man into a bathroom and beat him maybe to death , while his clueless girlfriend essentially regards his sadistic behaviors as something along the old maxim \" boys will be boys \" . \nanother character , schlubby businessman reacts to the loss of his job by actually killing his own baby ! \nwhat was once so powerful about labute\'s work , the casual , nonchalant cruelty and selfishness ( often elements we all have in us amplified to a disgusting degree ) had become so over the top it was borderline comic . \nobviously , at this point , labute could use a dose of some different kind of material before he pigeon holes himself further , but nurse betty isn\'t it . \nhe clearly has little passion for what he\'s doing here , instead replacing his mojo with strained quirks ( one of the hit men is a huge soap fan , and the character of betty would be little more than a one joke gimmick if zelllweger hadn\'t managed to transcend that ) tailor made to appeal to the widest possible audience . \nnearly every scene between chris rock and morgan freeman fatally slows the picture down , as the two are made to enact soft-boiled tarantino-esque dialogue . \nthey evince little chemistry , with rock constantly in over the top rant mode , acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling a hit man ( an occupation that\'s represented far too frequently in movies nowadays ) . \ni think rock is a great comic yet he hasn\'t been able to bring his feral intelligence to movies , whenever he acts , and no matter the part , it\'s like he\'s doing the damn chris rock show . \nsurprisingly ( at least considering her work in me , myself and irene ) renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance , building on her baby faced , apple pie looks . \nthat wide-open face and helium voiced earnestness suggests a little girl not fully grown into her thirty-year-old body . \nit\'s the best work she\'s ever done . \nfreeman is effective as always , though his performance nonetheless suffers because it seems at odds with where the movie wants to take it . \nthe actor plays the role in his usual calm , collected manner , though the flick tries to insinuate a symbolic kinship between his character and betty\'s , suggesting that both are controlled by their fantasies rather than reality . \nthat\'s interesting but the movie doesn\'t do anything with it other than crash land the sub-theme into a labored speech in the midst of a badly staged gun battle . \nthe film has good moments ( many of the scenes involving a very good greg kinnear , especially his confrontation with zellweger ) , an almost soothing , lyrical score ( and you know a movie\'s in trouble when the score sticks out as one of the best things about it ) but nothing jells , it\'s parts , good or bad , are so disparate as to be opposing . \nthe film might have worked had it settled on being one type of film , a mainstream , female forrest gump or an oddball art film , but as both if it falls as flat as diet coke . \nbetty\'s screenplay makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence , without which betty wouldn\'t make any progress in the film . \nnurse betty is a film driven by coincidence rather than charter , like how betty becomes a nurse in the film , a job that she takes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover ; she happens to be at the hospital at the exact moment that a drive by shooting takes place and miraculously knows how to take care of the victim\'s wound because she happened to see how on tv , which leads to her being offered a room with the victim\'s girlfriend who eventually gets betty into a party where she meets kinnear ? ? ? a little too tidy , don\'tcha think . \nbetty has an interesting theme , though it doesn\'t even seem aware of this . \nthe current state of tv has been leaning towards reality television what with the enormous success of survivor and moderate success of big brother , with more on the way . \nthis is a film about a women so deluded as to think that her favorite soap opera is reality ( ironically real-life survivor sean kennif has taken a part as a doctor on the soap opera guiding light ) . \ninstead of exploring this timely matter in a way relating to the current tv craze ( since the film does largely appear to be a satire of television , albeit one that would feel more appropriate in the \'80s than the \'00s ) , the film simply uses betty\'s delusions as a plot device to get her from point a to b . no progress is made and little is unearthed except that maybe labute could use a bit of rest and a lot of contemplation . \n'

?,'dear god , this is a fantastically bad film ! \nregardless of what i say about knock off , you can\'t grasp its awfulness from my words . \nyou have to see it and experience it for yourself . \nhere\'s the kicker , though -- i suggest that you do so . \nyes , this is a bad film -- easily one of the most incompetent films of the year -- but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure . \nin fact , i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time , despite the dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story . \ndon\'t get me wrong : i\'m not excusing knock off . \nit reaches an unacceptable level of badness ; it\'s so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was . \nit also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon , michael wong , paul sorvino , and -- of course -- jean-claude van damme . \nit does , however , have the entertaining presence of rob schneider , and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark . \nas i watched it , i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness . \nnow , in retrospect , it seems clear that it wasn\'t , but it\'s still a fascinating kind of mess . \ni don\'t like writing plot descriptions ( it is , by far , the most boring part of writing a review ) , but , in this case , i\'m off the hook : there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off . \nfor the sake of comparison , i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing . \ni paid closer attention to knock off , and the only thing i am able to say about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray , and is accused by the cia ( i think ) of selling knock off products ( knock off products are , of course , products that look like name-brand materials but are generic and cheap ) . \ni don\'t know what any of this has to do with martial arts , but there are lots of martial arts in the film . \nray is good at martial arts , so when he has to beat up bad guys , there\'s no problem . \nrob schneider plays his sidekick , although i had no idea who he really was by the end of the film . \nlela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff , while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once ! \nin fact , every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do . \nin that order , knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense . \nbut what a strange mess it is . \nit was written by stephen e . de souza , who also wrote die hard and 48 hours . \ncan this be the same man ? \ni don\'t see how , unless , of course , huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time . \nknock off seems to have an interesting premise ( as far as action films go ) , but there\'s no semblance here . \nfor instance , van damme is introduced , and then seconds later he\'s running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong . \nwhy ? \nwho knows . \nwhat are the implications of this ? \ni have no idea . \nmost action films abandon depth in favor of action , and this is normally a problem . \nknock off , however , is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut . \nthe acting is embarrassingly bad : rochon , in particular , delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity . \nsorvino , in addition , deserves better than this . \nvan damme is bad , but he\'s charming in that bad way , and so i can\'t say that he\'s hard to watch ( although i rarely understood what he was saying ) . \nthe only exception is rob schneider , who is actually quite funny a lot of the time . \ntsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison . \nthey\'re all pointless gimmicks though , such as shots of the inner-workings of a knock off running shoe . \nbut his action scenes are never boring : one particular piece inside of a fruit factory ( a fruit factory ?

?,'taking a few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking , go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers . \nthe story centres around a group of people , who include brit simon ( askew ) , and checkout girls claire ( holmes ) and ronna ( polley ) and the misadventures that they get into , split into three chapters . \neverything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers . \nalthough qt\'s touch is evident in nearly every frame , go is entertaining enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride . \nliman , who also photographed the film , has a deft touch with the camera , and the film looks good . \nthe film also seems to have benefited from a budget , with the night-club scenes in particular looking pretty good . \nthere\'s a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk . \nthe young cast are talented and help bring the story to life . \nholmes , one of the dawson\'s creek cast ( a show i\'m not particularly fond of ) displays much talent here , and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature . \naskew is slightly successful , being rather obnoxious . \nno doubt the filmmakers intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him , but instead of \'funny annoying\' he\'s just annoying . \nhe drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters , but the talent around him in that particular tale more than makes up for it . \nthe real standout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl : her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining . \nalso entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer , who gives an nice evil performance . \nthe script , written john august , is sharp and witty , with good dialogue and some funny jokes . \nit starts off rather slow however , but in about twenty minutes the script has found it\'s footing and just keeps getting better . \nthe stories are largely satisfying , although occasionally there\'s too much attention on one detail but not on another . \nalso , some of the endings seem a little forced and lucky . \nstill , the cast have a meaty script to get into and obviously enjoy it . \nit could of tried a little harder in some parts however , and these parts lag . \nbecause this is a gen-xer movie , the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany , and go\'s one is pretty decent . \nunlike other gen-xers movies , go never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue , which is a plus . \ngo is a very easy movie to absorb into , and the audience really starts feeling for these characters . \nthankfully , they never become two dimensional characters who are bent and twisted throughout the movie to fit into the stories mechanics ( like the heroine in 10 things i hate about you . ) \nthey are who they are and they stay that way . \ngo is great fun , and a worthy follow up from the director of swingers . \nignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction and very bad things , and just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride . \nerm , go to go , i guess . \n'

?,'jake kasdan , son of one of the best screenwriters around , breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hard-to-categorize detective story : part mystery , part comedy , part character study and part romance . \nfor the most part , kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully and create a captivating film . \ndaryl zero ( bill pullman ) is a modern day sherlock holmes . \nthe parallel is present down to his love of music ( though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin ) , and his addiction to drugs ( amphetamines , rather than morphine ) . \nhe even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces , the case about the man who lied about his age , or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes . \nhowever zero\'s observance of the fine art of detachment , though it makes him a brilliant private investigator , makes him somewhat of a self-imposed outcast in society . \nhe could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr . watson , i mean steve arlo ( ben stiller ) . \narlo is not happy with his job . \nhe is thrilled to be around zero\'s brilliance , but his bizarre behavior , and strange requests , are frustrating to the former lawyer . \nand they\'re even more so to his girlfriend , jess ( angela featherstone ) , who is fed up that her boyfriend\'s boss means more to arlo than her . \nthis is the situation when a new case comes knocking . \ngregory stark ( ryan o\'neill ) hires zero to find his lost keys . \nit seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring , and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence . \nnow , stark is being blackmailed , and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end . \nto solve this case , zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell . \nhowever , this is when he is vulnerable . . . and \nthis time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic , gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) , who may be involved in the blackmail scheme . \nfor the first time , zero has to question his own objectivity , as he finds his client less and less sympathetic . \nzero effect is weakest in its obviously \" wacky \" scenes depicting daryl zero\'s odd behavior . \nsuch scenes might be appropriate in an out-and-out satire , making zero an ace ventura-ish character . \nhowever , there\'s a much meatier movie in here . . . it just takes a while to get out . \nthat\'s not to say that there\'s not a place for humor in this film . \nin fact , some of the best scenes are ben stiller\'s wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust and frustration with his employer . \nhowever , the over-the-top scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film , and they aren\'t funny enough to stand on their own . \nonce the investigation is underway , however , zero\'s brilliance really begins to shine . \nhis lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many of sherlock\'s own . \nas the mystery begins to unfold , zero\'s deductions lead the plot in interesting directions , but never lose the viewer . \nzero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well . \nzero\'s relationship with gloria is low-key , but it hits all the right notes . \nhowever , we are always kept distant from gloria\'s character . \nshe\'s given plenty of development , but we never understand what she is thinking . \nperhaps that may be intentional : to place the audience in zero\'s zone of detachment . \nbut , on the whole , it is frustrating . \nbill pullman , when he\'s not spacing out , creates a vibrant character in daryl zero . \nthere\'s one moment when zero briefly connects to the world which he has managed to detach from for many years , and it is shockingly moving . . . expressing a seriousness that heretofore was unassociated with the character , but one which fits in well . \nand , although it is sometimes hard to take a detective called \" zero \" seriously , it is at this moment that the viewer understands the meaning behind the name . \nalthough zero effect is a bit awkward in places , it is a strong debut for kasdan , and shows great promise . \n'

?,'in 1998 , director brett ratner and his stars , jackie chan and chris tucker , breathed new life into the buddy-action film genre with the cross-cultural \" rush hour \" - to the tune of about $250 million . \nyou don\'t mess with success , so the team is back again , and better , in \" rush hour 2 . \" \nthe combo of the terrific physical talents of chan and the non-stop motor mouth of tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in \" rush hour \" that played well to audiences around the world . \nthe formula worked so well , in fact , that the sequel was inevitable . \ni\'m never thrilled with the idea of a follow-up to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations . \nsurprisingly , \" rush hour 2 \" wastes no time getting down to business and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it . \nthe script , by jeff nathanson ( utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the first film ) , wastes no time getting to the point right from the start . \nterrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong , killing two american translators , and chief inspector lee ( jackie chan ) is handed the job of solving the crime . \nconcurrently , his friend james carter ( chris tucker ) arrives on the island for some much needed r&r and expects his friend to spend some time and show him the sights . \ninstead , lee drags carter into the case and the duo get involved in stopping a conspiracy to counterfeit hundreds of million of us dollars . \nthe makers of \" rush hour 2 \" are working at a distinct advantage over the original . \nwe , the viewer , are familiar with the two lead characters and the already-existing chemistry that chan and tucker developed so well the first time around . \nthat chemistry was a high point ( and probably the saving point ) before and , now , the pair wears their friendship like a comfortable suit . \nlittle time is wasted in getting to know the key players so the screenplay capitalizes on those things we liked best in \" rush hour . \" \nfirst and foremost to me , in \" rh2 , \" is the immense pleasure in watching jackie chan\'s artistry in fight choreography . \nthe 47-year old martial arts master has a renowned reputation for doing all of his own stunt work and , here , he does not disappoint . \nchan\'s use of props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand , such as a trash bucket . \nhis moves look every bit as good as they ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding , on the tail end of a yacht , in a hong kong massage parlor and , for the finale , in a las vegas casino . \nlike harold lloyd or buster keaton , chan takes pride in putting his physical self on the line in pursuit of his artistry and is a joy to watch . \nchris tucker reprises his role as the motor mouthed la cop , carter , who teams , again , with lee to put down the bad guys . \nwhen he is unceremoniously pulled from his vacation to help his colleague and friend with the big case , he still looks to have some fun . \nwhen lee goes into a karaoke bar , the lair of chief bad guy ricky tan ( john lone ) and his hoods , carter takes the spotlight on stage with a credible michael jackson riff . \nthe comedian made the move from the improv stage to the big screen and , with jackie chan , has a franchise to hang his coat on to pay the bills . \nthe combo of chan\'s flying feet and fists with tucker\'s fast mouth make a duet more endearing than riggs and murtaugh in the \" lethal weapon \" films . \nthe supporting cast is here to move things along efficiently . \njohn lone , as ricky tan , is a suave villain who is the real power behind the throne of american bigwig steven reign ( alan king in a walk through performance ) . \nlone doesn\'t chew scenery or make pronouncements to \" get lee and carter , \" but gives the chief bad guy elegance . \nzhang zi-yi ( \" crouching tiger , hidden dragon \" ) continues to display her martial arts skills as ricky\'s taciturn henchlady , hu li , who carries on an ongoing battle with carter . \n ( carter has a problem , through most of the film , with hitting a woman , but this falls aside with their eventual one-on-one melee at the conclusion . ) \nroselyn sanchez is knockdown gorgeous ( and resembles sandra bullock ) as undercover agent isabella molina -

?,'the film starts out with a creepy opening sequence to which has the now classic and creepy score by writer/director/producer john carpenter who in my mind is a brilliant director , he really is . \nhe wrote this film , he directed this film , he produced this film and he made the excessively creepy score to this film . \ni think he is and always will be famous for this classic which after 21 years has not lost it\'s popularity or it\'s ability to scare the wits out of people . \ni think i have seen \'halloween\' over 100 times and each time i find something new and brilliant , and each time i am scared even though i know what is going to happen . \ni own three different versions of the film : a vhs regular version that came with a limited edition 20th anniversary t-shirt , a boxed edition vhs in a hardcover case digitally re-mastered with the original theatrical widescreen presentation , in a nifty plastic picture decorated box with a numbered snow-globe . \nin other words i am completely and utterly obsessed with the film . \nit has changed horror movies forever and spawned six sequels with only 2 , 4 , and 7 being truly good . \nit also spawned several cheap imitations of the film that were offensive in some ways to a true halloween fan . \nsince i heard about halloween being released on dvd in a limited edition of 30 , 000 copies , i knew i had to buy one no matter what ! \ni did and man to me it\'s the best dvd ever manufactured with the brilliance of the film . \nno words can describe the dvd . \nin \'halloween\' michael myers is a evil person whom killed his sister in cold blood 16 years ago in 1963 . \nnow in 1978 grown up and in a mental hospital michael myers escapes to go back to his hometown of haddonfield , illinois , followed by his past doctor sam loomis . \nthe person michael is targeting is laurie strode who is played by jamie lee curtis in her film debut . \nwhy is he stalking her ? \ncheck out halloween ii it explains it all . \non this unholy night on october 31 , 1978 laurie strode and her two friends are going to have the time of their lives , which is trying to stay alive . \nthe whole film is filled with terrifying moments most coming from just seeing michael myers walk . \nnick castle who played the shape in the first movie did an incredible job , and no other person in any other halloween flick can do what he did . \nwhat john carpenter did in 1978 is made a ground-breaking new film , with scares , wit , and style . \nthe movie is flawless if not perfect . \nno other movie or sequel has lived up to this one , and in my opinion never will . \n\'halloween\' will be like \'psycho\' and still be extremely popular even almost 40 years later . \ni just hope someday \'halloween\' will be released in a new dolby soundtrack with the 4 extra scenes on the dvd edition . \n\'halloween\' isn\'t just another slice-and-dice horror flick , it\'s an intelligent , horrifying and best film experience ever made . \nsee \'halloween\' and be scared . . . . then \nwatch it again ! \nreviewed by brandon herring october 7 , 1999 . \n'
?,'i still can\'t figure out why people went in droves to see this movie . \nnow before you go assuming i\'m some sort of high brow snob , who can\'t appreciate a little dumb humor , let me say that i love cheap humor . \ni thought there\'s something about mary was one of the funniest films that i have ever seen and it was certainly one of the best films of 1998 . \nlow brow adolescent humor can be a lot of fun , the problem with the waterboy is that it is just low brow and adolescent , there is no humor component . \ni wanted to like the waterboy , i really did . \ni think i only laughed maybe 2 or 3 times throughout the entire movie . \nactually , i smiled a couple of more times on top of that . \nnot a great record for a 90-minute film . \nthe problem with the waterboy is the same as most other adam sandler movies . \nthose responsible for this mess seem to think that the sheer fact that sandler walks around using a goofy voice and playing dumb the entire movie is a substitute for actual funny material . \nnothing could be further from the truth , as matter of fact , sandler\'s idiot voice started to get on my nerves at points in this film . \nit\'s really a shame too , because this film had the potential to be very funny . \ni personally believe that sandler is probably a very talented comedian , it\'s just that so far he hasn\'t been able to find the right film to showcase his talents . \nif his only talent is making goofy voices and playing morons , my guess is that his career in the movies will go down the same road as the vast majority of the former stars of saturday night live . \nmost of whom are now happily no longer in the entertainment industry . \nsandler plays a 31-year-old , somewhat mentally challenged , waterboy for a college football team . \nthe team\'s somewhat mentally disturbed coach ( henry winkler ) realizes that his waterboy has a great deal of pent-up rage , which , if harnessed properly , would make him a force to be reckoned with on the football field . \nyou can figure out the rest from here . \nsandler joins the team and this once lowly waterboy becomes a football star . \nas i said , the film had a great deal of potential . \nthe idea was a decent one , but the main potential of this movie is a result of the cast . \nall of whom are very good , just hamstrung by really , really , lousy material . \neven sandler , annoying goofy voice and all , has enough charisma and natural comedic ability to overcome some of his bad material . \neven as unfunny as his character is , i still found myself rooting for him throughout the film . \nbut it is the supporting cast that i feel most badly about . \nif their material had been just a bit better , this film could have been such a funny movie . \nfairuza balk plays sandler\'s leather-wearing biker-chick love interest and does a great job playing sleazy and sexy at the same time . \nwinkler is great as the coach who uses a \" coaching for dummies \" -style book to help him get through games . \nthe real standout though , is kathy bates . \neven with some of the worst material of her career to deal with , she is still a treat to watch in her role as sandler\'s overprotective and overbearing mama . \neven with the performances of bates and winkler , there is absolutely no way i would recommend this movie . \nalthough i get the distinct impression that without them , this film would have ranked in negative numbers for me . \nwhich is sad , because i can\'t really put my finger on a particular element of the movie and single it out as the cause of the disaster that it became . \nit\'s obvious that those involved , specifically the actors , tried very hard to make what they thought was going to be a funny movie . \nit\'s just too bad that 99 percent of all of the jokes fell flat . \n'
?,'i have to admit that i disliked this film initially . \nit certianly isn\'t for every taste , and it\'s sheer torture to sit through if you\'re in a restless mood . \nthat said , if you are in the right mood , it\'s absolutely incredible . \nthis was my second favorite movie of 1998 , and would have been a shoo-in for first in almost any other year . \nperhaps the big turn-off for many was this film\'s unconventionality . \ni\'d be hard-pressed to compare it to any other film that i\'ve seen - it is very , very artsy , incredibly slow - and amazingly , it works beautifully . \non my second viewing , i realized that the film follows the three act structure ( i didn\'t think it had any sort of structure at all when i first saw it ) . \nthe first act serves to set up the characters - sort of . \nit exists even moreso to set a mood of tension and restlesness , and perhaps even feelings of boredom . \nand then it is shattered by the intense violence of the second ( which encompasses most of the movie ) . \nthe majority of the film is one extended battle scene , intercut with brief flashbacks and voice-overs . \nthe artsier elements do not detract from the action , but add to it - they succeed in briefly letting the viewer peek into the minds of the soldiers , only to be suddenly yanked back into reality when the battle resumes . \nthe battle scenes are amazing ( second only to \" saving private ryan \" in my opinion ) . \nthey\'re brutal , horrifying , and at times beautiful due to the amazing cinematography . \nthe second act is as immersive , brilliant , and haunting as any film that i have ever seen . \nthe only problems come during the first and third acts . \nmalick takes a little too long to get the film started . \nalthough the initial scenes - which consist of two soldiers\' experiencing a near-eden-like paradise while going awol , and the preperations for battle - are effective and necessary , hints of pretentiousness sink in . \nthe film is just a tad too artsy near the beginning , and a lot of people that disliked the movie probably gave up on it because of this . \nthe final act is effective at winding the film down , but the problems from the first persist - it\'s a bit too long , and comes over as pretentious at times . \nthat said , there are two sequences ( one where a soldier gets a devastating note from his wife , and another where one of the main characters is killed ) that are nothing short of incredible . \nthe performances are phenominal all around . \nthe two standouts are nick nolte and newcomer jim caviezel , both of whom should have been nominated for oscars . \nnolte is riveting and intense as the colonel in charge of the operation . \nhis character is hard , mean , and somewhat reckless with the lives of his men , and yet nolte somehow manages to evoke sympathy for him . \ncaviezel is forever questioning the nature of war , his place in it , and if there\'s any deeper meaning to the hell that he\'s going through . \nhe is absolutely perfect - genuine , sympathetic , sincere , and yet strong when he needs to be . \nalthough restricted to a relatively small role , sean penn is also very good as the company\'s pessimistic seargent . \nas to how it stacks up to \" saving private ryan \" - it was my second favorite movie of 1998 , \" ryan \" was my first . \nit\'s really hard to compare the two - they are so , so different - so i won\'t , beyond saying that spielberg\'s film had more of an impact on me . \nhowever , the two are comparable from the standpoint of quality ( i can easily see why someone would \" the thin red line \" above \" ryan ) . \ni highly recommend both of them , and consider them to be the two best war movies ever made . \nall in all , \" the thin red line \" is filmmaking of an incredibly high order . \nit\'s slight faults are easily offset by the sheer brilliance of what is done right . \nit\'s a real shame that it tanked at the box office - films this unconventional , powerful , and thought-provoking don\'t come along very often . \n'
?,'it seemed like the perfect concept . \nwhat better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? \nit\'s exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh . \njim carrey\'s signed on too ? \neven better . \nthe national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers\' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as \" schizophrenia , \" and so forth . \nsuch a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers\' fire , proving that some people just couldn\'t take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy . \nyes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn\'t funny . \nit\'s not for lack of trying . \nthe farrellys utilize in \" me , myself & irene \" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them . \nthis , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult . \nsoon enough , charlie\'s repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster . \nthis guy isn\'t above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he\'s been insulted , or holding a little girl\'s head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street . \nthen things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks . \nsome have suggested that this isn\'t a problem , because the farrelly brothers\' brand of humor doesn\'t require plot to work . \nthey\'re wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys\' last effort , 1996\'s \" there\'s something about mary . \" \n ( 1999\'s \" outside providence \" was technically an earlier project . ) \nthe brothers\' earlier film wasn\'t funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected . \nin \" mary , \" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they\'d have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion . \n \" me , myself & irene , \" by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at \" mary \" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work . \nhaving been produced by the same guys who made \" mary , \" \" irene \" seems like an even bigger disappointment . \nthe brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes . \nbut they haven\'t come up with a way to make any of it fresh ; most of \" me , myself & irene \" comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy . \nthe plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who\'s in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that\'s entirely predictable from the get-go . \n ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? \nyeah , me too . ) \nthe farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven\'t already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be . \ncompared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it\'s no longer funny , merely gross . \nthe jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . \ntake , for example , the subplot involving charlie\'s three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . \nthe incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face . \nbut by the end of the film , they\'re still doing the same schitck ; it hasn\'t been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn\'t been dropped either . \nthat\'s too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . \n \" me , myself & irene \" reeks of wasted opportunities . \nthere ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie\'s new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank\'s actions . \nthis doesn\'t really happen ; nearly every supporting character learns about charlie\'s condition early on , so they don\'t have any opportunity to be surprised by it . \nthe film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , \" whitey \" ) , but the script doesn\'t go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . \njim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he\'s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in \" all of me . \" \nit\'s a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny . \ncarrey doesn\'t pull any stunts we don\'t expect him to pull , and the farrellys\' script doesn\'t give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren\'t set up in any meaningful way . \nperhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . \nzellweger\'s irene is not a strong female lead ; mary in \" mary \" may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed . \nirene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she\'s ditzy , clever , or neither . \nas such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only \" sane \" person in the film . \nchris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this . \nhe , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected . \nafter viewing the shapeless mess that \" me , myself & irene \" eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . \nmaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . \nbut i don\'t believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . \nif the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they\'ll rebound just fine . \neven after that happens , though , i\'ll still consider \" me , myself & irene \" to be a high-caliber misfire . \n'

?,'the yet-to-be-released krippendorf\'s tribe is being marketed as a family comedy , but buyer beware . \nthis movie can\'t make up its mind . \nis it a family comedy with vulgar references to both the male and female bodies , menstruation , circumcision , and sex that would make any parents squirm at the thought of having their child next to them ? \nor is it an adult comedy approached with such immaturity that only adolescents will appreciate the effort ? \neither way , \" unbalanced \" is the word to stamp on this hit and miss and miss and miss effort . \nthe premise is catchy - widowed anthropology professor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ) has spent the past two years \" getting over \" the death of his wife , neglecting key research and squandering grant money on personal living expenses . \nnow it\'s time to show what he\'s achieved in those two years , and he has absolutely nothing to show for it . \nwith a fabricated tale of studying a previously undiscovered tribe in new guinea , krippendorf petitions for new funds while hiding the fact that the previous $100 , 000 grant was spent on trips to mcdonald\'s . \nbut when his \" discovery \" becomes the latest craze among colleagues , the professor finds he must do more than talk about the tribe - he must create it . \nwith the aid of his three children , the headstrong teen shelly ( natasha lyonne of everyone says i love you ) , the slightly younger mickey ( gregory smith ) , and the nine-year-old edmund ( carl michael lindner ) , the \" shelmikedmu \" tribe ( named from the first half of each child\'s name ) is born , and videos quickly produced in krippendorf\'s backyard are passed off as stunning documentary footage of the newly found new guinea tribe . \ndespite the professor\'s wishes , the buzz surrounding his discovery only grows , due in greatest part to veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , an overly vivacious ( and voluptuous ) anthropologist who barges her way into the discovery and basically deems herself krippendorf\'s main assistant . \nhungry for recognition , micelli sets up interviews , lectures , etc . in an effort to make this the biggest sociological event in history , a sure fire way to go down in the history books . \nkrippendorf , on the other hand , is seeing himself go down a jail cell corridor , not in history books , and with each new lecture , he must come up with something impressive to unleash about the tribe - mating habits , domestic structure , etc . thru fumbling improvisation , and often some quick thinking from his oldest son , krippendorf makes it thru each new lecture , but only creates more and more interest in the highly unique tribe . \non the opposing end is krippendorf\'s arch rival , ruth allen ( lily tomlin ) , an arrogant professor whose jealousy drives her on a mission to disprove the existance of the non-existent tribe . \nit\'s a cute idea , and approached with a more subtle ( and mature ) style , krippendorf\'s tribe could\'ve been a real winner . \nsadly , the mostly-misfired toilet humor , overly comical musical score ( by bruce broughton ) , and sugar coated sentiments ( all the key ingredients of a \" family comedy \" ) just aren\'t the right tone for this film . \ncut that crap out , add some razor sharp dialogue and witty sociological perceptions and you\'ve got a good start . \nat the state it\'s in now , you\'ve got something along the lines of medicine man meets mrs . \ndoubtfire meets dumb & dumber , and that\'s not a concoction anyone should be overly anxious to try . \nthe overall product here is a highly forgettable cup of \" average \" , with a few laugh-out-loud moments and a great big gap in between them . \nmost of the characters are surprisingly two-dimensional , and the only one who seems to exhibit any real acting effort ( lyonne ) seems to go greatly unappreciated . \ndirector todd holland has gone about making this film in all the wrong ways . \nit\'s stuck in limbo between disney family fare ( jungle 2 jungle ) and potentially hilarious adult comedy ( a fish called wanda ) . \nit\'s this unbalanced structure that really knocks it down a grade , and it\'s a brutal drop . \na strong warning to parents : forget the impression given by advertisements , do you want to take your kids to a film that has a woman asking a man if he finds her attractive merely because she\'s holding his penis ? \nyes , it\'s put that bluntly ! \njust be warned - this is merely one example of the many shocking subjects to be brought up in the film , and others might not be as tame . \n'

?,' \" payback , \" brian helgeland\'s inauspicious directing debut ( coincidentally , he previously penned the award-winning screenplay for 1997\'s \" l . a . confidential \" ) , is a wildly uneven and thoroughly unpleasant revenge thriller that takes one idea---a movie with non-stop violence , death , and villains---and runs with it , or should i say , barely manages to crawl away with it . \nmel gibson , in yet another disappointing picture ( \" conspiracy theory \" and \" lethal weapon 4 , \" anyone ? ) , stars as the reprehensible villain/hero , porter , a man who becomes determined to get his 50\% share of $140 , 000 , which he stole in a robbery , back when his partner-in-crime ( gregg henry ) and drug-addicted wife ( deborah kara unger ) double-cross him , shoot him , and leave him for dead . \nporter is not dead , however---not by a long shot---as he quickly rehabilitates and , along with his loyal prositute girlfriend , rosie ( maria bello ) , sets out to make everyone involved in the scam pay . \nthe tagline for \" payback \" is , \" get ready to root for the bad guy , \" and sure enough , this is true , as pretty much every significant character who appears is crooked in some way . \ni wouldn\'t have a problem with this offbeat detail if the painfully thin story had been of any interest , but it wasn\'t , and therefore , i found myself having an especially laborious time investing myself into a wide array of character that have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever . \nno attempt is made to flesh the roles into three-dimensional characters , and there are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity in them . \njust because the protagonist , a \" bad guy , \" is played by mel gibson doesn\'t mean i will \" root for him , \" and i didn\'t . \nquite the contrary , every person in the movie deserved to die a gory death ( although some of them did , anyway , just to spice up the dull proceedings ) . \nsince none of the respectable actors in \" payback \" actually have human beings to play , only one performance managed to stand out . \nlucy alexis liu ( of t . v . \'s \" ally mcbeal \" ) , who plays a spicy s&m dominatrix , brightens up every scene she is in , and has a definite flair for comedy , something i would have liked to have seen more of , since most of the humor fell with a resounding splat . \nmeanwhile , gibson , who is perfectly fine here , sleepwalks through a role that is not the least bit challenging . \nunger , who made an impression in 1997\'s \" the game , \" is surprisingly wasted and it is difficult to see why she took such a part since she disappears ten minutes in , and only has two purproses : ( 1 ) to get high on heroin , and ( 2 ) because she plays a key part in an early flashback . \nfinally , kris kristofferson appears in a throwaway role during the climax , and this unnecessary plot development sticks out like a sore thumb ( tellingly , he didn\'t appear in the original cut of the film , but was cast when extensive reshoots took place months later ) . \nlike most action movies , the star often takes a licking but keeps on ticking . \nin the course of the 102-minute running time of \" payback , \" porter is shot three times in the back , hit by a van , beaten up , and has his feet smashed with a sledgehammer . \nand guess what ? \nnot only does he survive the whole ordeal , but he is happy-go-lucky in the penultimate sequence ( and can still walk ! ) , \neven though he looks like he had recently substituted for a punching bag . \n \" payback \" is not , in any way , an entertaining film , even though i am sure the makers hoped it would be with all the graphic carnage that goes on , but take away that violence and what you are basically left with is a blank screen . \nperhaps director helgeland would have been smart to consider this , so he could have at least added a few worthwhile elements , like a fresh storyline and characters whom you could even remotely stand to be around for a few hours . \n'

\nfor the most part , it is because the filmmakers understand \nthe comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match . \nthe crow and batman comics call for a dark gothic atmosphere , which the director provided . \nthe mask features a wacky superhero with off the wall antics , which the casting and cg effects reflect . \nsuperman \nis not over the top with colour and flash , and the film reflects this . \nblade uses common notions of vampires and incorporates them into the film , creating an appropriate atmosphere . \nthis is in stark contrast to joel schumacher\'s contrived vision in batman and robin , reflecting the dated atmosphere in the 1960\'s television show . \nbatman and robin proved that the director failed to realize one fundamental fact : comics have grown up , and so has the audience ( i\'m working on a scathing review of batman and robin and will post it up when i\'m ready ) . \nwhich brings me back to blade . \nalthough he may be a familiar character to some , due to his appearances in the spider-man animated show on fox , one will find no single trace of the warm-and-fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted in the cartoon . \nthe film depicts a vicious vampire killer that \nuses every single means at his disposal to reach his ends . \nthe end results are not pretty by any means . \nthe story elements work very well -- for a comic book story . \nscreenwriter david goyer ( who also wrote the crow ) incorporates interesting elements of vampire lore , using science to explain many of the ideas often dismissed in vampire films . \nthis is presented through karen , a hematologist portrayed by n\'bushe wright . \nthis leads to inventive use of standard medical treatments to kill vampires . \nadd this \nto the neat little gadgets that blade uses ( including a titanium sword complete with an \" anti-theft device \" ) , and one has an interesting premise . \nhowever , the film works best as an action film . \nactor wesley snipes has \nan extensive background in martial arts ( most of which comes from capoeira , a brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks ) , choreographing every single move . \nproving that quick , flash cutting edits are no substitute for choreographed fight sequences ( see batman and robin for a \ngood example of that ) , wesley snipes dazzles the audience with some incredible fight scenes . \nregardless , this film is far from perfect . \nthe film suffers from at least one major plot hole , regarding the summoning of the blood god . \nthe ritual requires that a number of pure blood vampires are standing on \nmarked squares , yet one of them is viciously murdered , allowing the ritual to pass ( and the murdered vampire is later shown standing on the square ) . \nobvious continuity errors also surface , especially during a scene where deacon frost takes a drag on his cigarette and is not exhaling it in the next frame ( there is no trace of smoke either ) . \nmuch of the special effects are not that spectacular either . \nwhile vampire disintegration scenes are intriguing to watch , other cgi ( computer generated imagery ) effects are almost slapped together , which is surprising when given the amount of time the film was given to be released ( the film\'s release date was pushed back multiple times ) . \nscenes with computer generated blood look extremely fake , knocking the believability factor down a few notches ( but then , i\'m really hard to impress ) . \nthe film\'s r rating comes from gory violence , but the lack of \nrealism made me wonder why it got such a rating ( for realistic violence , \nwatch \" saving private ryan \" ) . \nthe overuse of cgi in films has made me yearn for the days of director george romero and makeup wizard rob bottin , both pioneers in the art of gore without extensive use of cgi . \nstill , scenes involving non-cgi special effects do surface ( and look much more impressive ) , such as one particularly gruesome scene where a vampire tries to use blade\'s sword without deactivating the \" anti-theft device \" . \nwesley snipes is the saving grace behind what would have otherwise been a muddled mess . \nwhile not talking much , he is a grand physical presence , leaving other comic book superheroes in the dust . \na decent ( by comic book film standards ) storyline also helps . \n'

?,'based on the novel set in 1914 by joseph conrad , victory spins a tale of a pair of lovers , heyst ( william dafoe ) and alma ( irene jacob ) , who seek refuge on heyst\'s isolated island . \nhowever , their idyllic world begins to crumble upon the arrival of mr jones ( sam neil ) , martin ricardo ( rufus sewell ) and their servant , pedro ( graziano marcelli ) , who have come to steal heyst\'s rumoured plunder . \nwhile the novel is largely complex in characterization , the film sadly transposes conrad\'s characters into lacklustre leads , the most disappointing being heyst himself . \nconrad\'s heyst adheres religiously to his late father\'s ways of detachment and isolation . \nhis ascetic lifestyle is thrown into question when he meets alma , a helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice . \nthe struggle to embrace the arrival of alma into his solitude , however , is lost in mark peploe\'s ( director and writer ) diluted version of heyst . \nwithout properly establishing the crucial details of heyst\'s character , all that is left of conrad\'s main character is a very shallow treatment of his internal conflict between detachment and human involvement . \non the one hand , actualizing the subtext is a mammoth task ( though not impossible ) , but on the other hand , dafoe\'s flat acting cannot be excused as an attempt at stoicism . \nin the end , we are supposed to witness heyst renounce his philosophy and finally come to an understanding of what it is to love another . \nthe final transformation , while perceptible , lacks the cathartic revelation which is undeniable in conrad\'s novel . \nits absence in the film is unforgivable . \nthe film seems more concerned about moving the plot along when so much has yet to be said about the relationship between the two complete strangers . \nalma is supposed to have overcome great emotional barriers in the relationship , namely heyst\'s underlying philosophy of detachment , which heyst himself grapples with . \nthe struggle against heyst\'s ignorance of true human involvement accounts for much of the greatness of alma\'s love for him . \njacob , fair-skinned , gentle and yet passionate , handles the role with precision , detailing nuances where possible . \nunfortunately , she is let down by a superficial script . \nthe couple\'s relationship develops too hastily , leaving all subtlety effaced and replaced with a blatant show-and-tell approach . \nall we know of the characters are mostly explained by their lines alone . \nthis is unsatisfactory when so much of the turmoil experienced by the two stem from their buried thoughts and emotions . \nthe sketchy handling of their relationship stands out as sorely as dafoe\'s american accent ( an inappropriate one since heyst spent most of his life in london ) . \nthe other characters such as schomberg ( jean yanne ) , the owner of a hotel , and mr jones ( sam neill ) , also fall short of conrad\'s meticulous characterization . \nwhile schomberg should have been more menacing and vindictive , mr jones should have been portrayed as something more of an enigma . \nsam neil\'s caricature of a slightly stout , effeminate and soft-spoken gentleman-at-large nullifies the effect intended by conrad who describes mr jones as \" an insolent spectre on leave from hades , endowed with skin and bones and a subtle power of terror \" . \npoor characterization aside , kudos goes to rufus sewell for his excellent portrayal of ricardo , secretary to mr jones , a reckless ruffian capable of murder . \nsewell , with his cockney accent and large expressive green eyes , becomes the true terror of the unholy trinity , masterminding deceitful plans behind jones\' back . \nat the same time , we are entertained by the foolhardiness of his plans . \ndespite the authentic setting and marvellous cinematography by bruno de keyzer , very few images are left behind for us to savour after the film has ended . \nsourabaya and its surrounding islands and volcanoes may have their charm , but mean nothing once the film fails to capture the essence of an epic , which is what victory deserves to be . \nthe delicately inter-woven complexities in the love story are lost to an inadequate production . \nat the end of the film , we are told that perhaps alma\'s victory was in teaching heyst how to love . \na hollow victory indeed . \nthe flying inkpot\'s rating system : * wait for the video . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \n'

?,'david cronenberg presents us with another strange tale crawling out of his impressively twisted head . \nit is one of many science fiction films , released during the last year of this millenium , that tackles issues that will play an important role in our future . \nthe story unfolds in a near future , where the line between reality and virtual reality blurs . \nthe world of the future is an unfriendly place , where the scared inhabitants are \" hiding \" in virtual reality fantasy games to escape the uncertainty of the real world . \nallegra geller ( jennifer jason leigh ) , the leading game designer in the world , is testing her new virtual reality game , existenz with a focus group . \nas they begin , she is attacked by a fanatic assassin employing a bizarre organic gun . \nshe flees with a young marketing trainee , ted pikul ( jude law ) , who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard . \nunfortunately , her pod , an organic gaming device that contains the only copy of the existenz game program , is damaged . \nto inspect it , she talks ted into accepting a gameport in his own body so he can play the game with her . \nthe events leading up to this , and the resulting game lead the pair on a strange adventure in a world where individuality doesn\'t exist , as the \" players \" are forced to perform as characters in an unknown plot . \nhere the reality and their actions are impossible to determine from either their own or the game\'s perspective . \ni don\'t intend to reveal more of the film\'s premise , which is structured as a computer game , with \" tasks \" that the characters must complete to win the game . \nreleased after \" the matrix \" and \" dark city \" , \" existenz \" has some similarities and parallels that connect it to these films . \nhowever , \" existenz \" is moving in a different direction , with a premise of its own . \na combination of dazzling special effects , brilliantly coordinated action sequences and an intelligent and sophisticated plot , made \" the matrix \" a rare and entertaining science fiction experience , with some dark and frightening ideas hidden under its sparkling facade . \n \" existenz \" has a completely different atmosphere , resembling \" dark city \" , which is darker , more serious and less entertaining . \n \" existenz \" has the opportunities and potential , but the enormous possibilities are never quite explored . \nafter the engaging beginning , it starts to falter . \nwhile i was watching the film , many left the theatre during the first hour . \nand indeed , \" existenz \" seemed as a complete failure : the actors seemed unreal , the plot and dialogue silly , unfinished relationships and unexplained events followed one after another . \nbut the last fifteen minutes lifted the film on a complete different level , explaining all past events , the silly dialogue and the unreal performances within a few scenes . \nand jet the film fails on several issues . \nprobably the best written character in the story is a game designer , who would rather spend the rest of her life in a virtual world , than face real life . \nthis is a great possibility to create a magnificent character , and jennifer jason leigh stretches cronenberg\'s script to the limits , but fails because the advantages of virtual reality in comparison to the real world are never shown . \nexistenz is not a world of which you might dream about in your fantasies . \nit is not a world worth sacrificing your life for . \nit\'s a cold , dark place where the \" players \" are forced to interrelate with unreal characters , eat mutated creatures and even murder against their own will . \nit doesn\'t look like a place worth even thinking about . \ndavid cronenberg has been the creator of \" the fly \" , \" videodrome \" and \" the dead zone \" , so it\'s not so hard to guess that \" existenz \" is a violent and gory film . \nbesides the regular murders of innocent people , the audiences can enjoy an autopsy of a two-headed mutated amfibium . \nscenes like that have become a trademark for cronenberg and it seems that he can\'t make a film without flowing blood and foul creatures . \nthe way i see it , this is the film\'s crucial failure . \nit is impossible for cronenbergto create a beautiful world where time , space and problems of our everyday life do not exist ; a place of blooming blossoms , green forests and clear waters ; a place really worth sacrificing your life for . \nbecause of its lack of three dimensionality , the film looses most of its possibilities , but stays afloat because of some interesting scenes , amusing performances ( especially by willem dafoe ) and one interesting and important thought , depicted in many different ways throughout the movie . \nduring the film , the audience is as confused as the characters : detached from their everyday existence and no longer able to see the difference between the real world and the alternative reality that they have created . \n \" the matrix \" , despite of its many dark and disturbing thoughts , ends with a light at the end of the tunnel . \n \" existenz \" does not . \nit is a one time experience , ending in blood , gore and madness - a rather frightening forecast for tomorrow . \n'

s are also the order of the day with mission to mars . \ndialogue and character motivations are all lifted directly from countless other science fiction films that have all done it better and with more style ( even independence day , which lifted all of it\'s premises from other sci-fi films was better than this film , and i don\'t like independence day ) . \nfilms like 2001 : a space odyssey , the abyss , and close encounters of the third kind are all blatantly stolen from ( and poorly at that ) . \nthere is even a sequence where a rover is traveling through a canyon , and i couldn\'t help but whisper \" u\'tinni \" to myself and wait for a jawa to quickly hide in the rocks before the rover could get a glimpse of it . \nthis film also features one of my all-time least favorite movie clich ? s : the \" he would have wanted you to have this \" moment , where one character gives another a trinket that yet another character is established as constantly having ( and is usually made fun of by the character who ends up getting all sappy over it later on ) . \nscenes like these always bother me when they come out of nowhere in regular films , but in a film as clich ? ridden as this , it is particularly irritating . \nennio morricone\'s music is usually considered to be some of the best stuff in the projects he works on , but here it is dreadfully overbearing . \nhis music sounds like it came straight out of a vincent price movie in certain scenes . \nat other times his music is unbearably over-dramatic . \none sequence involving a daring spacewalk rescue is given a particularly cheesy sting when it is discovered that the grappling hook device used for the rescue won\'t reach its intended target . \nmission to mars is push button filmmaking to the greatest extreme . \nevents are set into motion that are obvious to anyone who has ever seen a movie and seem like they are just there to evoke an emotional response in the audience . \nwe are apparently supposed to be upset that tim robbins character removes his helmet in deep space and kills himself to save his wife , but i felt extreme boredom coupled with a twinge of disinterest . \nwhat makes it all worse is that fact that there is no real reason that robbins\' character needs to turn himself into a popsicle , except to invoke an emotional response ( i could think of at least one way to save him , and the nasa clowns in this film are supposed to be \" smarter \" than i am ) . \nduring the finale , when we are finally introduced to the translucent , conehead , kitty-faced aliens that we ostensibly sprung from , we are presented with some of the most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put to film ( just slightly worse than the plane crash at the end of air force one or the hell scenes in spawn ) . \na brief history lesson about \" where we came from \" is proffered , then sinise is whisked away to be with \" the rest of our people \" ( he does this because his late wife proclaims in a video he watches early on that \" this is a chance to step foot where no one else has \" ) . \n>from the press i\'ve been seeing this film receive , it is apparent that mission to mars will be dying a quick death at the theater . \ni\'m sure the first weekend or two will be huge , but once word gets out people will stop going . \nlet\'s just hope the upcoming red planet is better than this and isn\'t hurt by the negativity this film is generating . \ni\'d venture to say it won\'t be worse than this waste of time . \n[pg] \n'

\nthis film has evoked protests and objections from the arab-american population in the u . s . and n . y . especially . \nbut to me these protests seem unnecessary . \nzwick is careful to not step over the line and make the palestinians typical hollywood bad guys . \nthe script is therefore wonderfully balanced . \nagent hubbard\'s best friend and loyal colleague frank haddad ( tony shalhoub ) is lebanese-american . \nand it is quite often you hear lines such as \" my first boyfriend was palestinian . \nthey seduce you with their suffering \" or \" they love this country as much as we do . \" \nbut no matter how you twist this matter , you won\'t get away from the fact that when it comes to world wide terrorism it is arab-speaking population who are in the great majority . \nmore to the point , the siege demonstrates the injustice of blanket condemnation of any ethnic group by depicting the unfair treatment of all arab-americans by the u . s . military . \nand thus this film does not serve as a source for discrimination in any ! \nway . \ndenzel washington is dashing as always . \nin this role he is much more determined and stronger than usual . \nanette bening is enjoyable and believable as a shadowy cia operative who prefers espionage , a network of snitches and seduction to gather information . . \nbruce willis is terrifying as the sadist , hungry for power , that never looses his connection with the audience , since his point of view is not too hard to understand . \nthe film is elegantly shaped . \nthe scenes are easily floating into each other and the film never seems overlong . \nzwick knows exactly how to provoke tension , horror and emotions and does it with a rarely observed professionalism . \nhe tightens the intensity as the events progress . \nand when a plot twist comes , it actually is surprising . \nit is not a film drained in patriotism , like the work of roland emerich . \nnor is it a film that portrays explosions purely for entertainment values . \nit is a daring picture that has courage enough to undertake such a risky story and difficult journey . \nit has courage enough to get involved in politics . \nit questions our foreign policies , mentality and defense . \ni must admit that it ends rather disappointing , as the director turns the patriotism way up and innovation down . \nbut despite of that , it is certainly an intelligent and thrilling film that provokes emotions and thoughts ; a virtue that few summer films can boast of . \n \" this is the u . s . army . \nit\'s a broadsword , not a scalpel . \nbelieve me , you do not want us in an american city \" - gen . william devereaux , \" the siege \" \n'

?,'after the huge success of \" the exorcist \" in 1973 a sequel was inevitable , and sadly like most horror fims that make money , the filmmakers decided to make a ridiculous sequel , that makes absolutely no sense at all , and to me was extremely pointless , wasting linda blair and max von sydow completely . \nneedless , dumb sequel flopped in the box office , and never gained much success though it is voted as one of the worst sequels of all time , to which i agree with . \nto start the \" story \" it is four years later , and regan is being tormented by memories of what used to be , now a priest played by richard burton , is trying to figure out why this demon tried to possess regan , and now the demon somehow wants to possess her again ( maybe she was good or something ) . \nnow they must try to stop this demon from taking over regan\'s body , before it is too late . \nsome of the bad things exorcist ii has in it is : linda blair , she had no need to revive her character , and she is really terrible in this film , she brings it down to a lull , and in places it seems like it just stops in its place , and doesn\'t go anywhere . \nlouise fletcher is alright for what it\'s worth , but she could have done a lot better than this . \nthe direction by john boorman , is that of a confused , stylish nature that i really couldn\'t figure out . \nin fact , i had no idea what was going on in this film , the script was jumbled , the plot was jumbled , and the ending is just laugh out loud hilariosly bad . \nfor those exorcist fans who haven\'t seen this one , i recommend renting it . \ni actually gave this one a high rating , if it were any worse it would have deserved zero pumpkins , i went easy on it however because of the fact that it has a bit of good direction , but nothing else ! \nim not saying i like the film now , so dont start going anywhere . \nbad , bad , bad movie . \n'

) . \ni have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film . \nthere\'s not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good . \nin this respect , the film never disappointed me . \nthis film reaches a level that transcends the \" so bad it\'s good \" level and borders on the downright insane . \nthe effects are awful , the script is contrived , and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously ( i think ) . \ni challenge anyone to sit through the scene , where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner , with a straight face . \nthankfully , the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with . \ndina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in ( johnny mnemonic , dragonheart , and starship troopers . . . \nthe latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit ) , and this one is no exception . \nwhile one never really gets the impression that meyer\'s character could be a bat expert in reality , one never really cares to doubt it either . \nshe gives as good a performance as could be expected , plus she\'s nice to look at for an hour and a half . \nlou diamond phillips is also serviceable here , as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero . \nalthough when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for what\'s going on in town , for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats . \nthe only bad performance in the film is that of leon\'s . \nhe is relegated to the \" i\'m not sticking around here !

?,'50\'s `aliens vs . \nearth\' idea revamped ! \nif you have been following the movie news over the net , you could not have escaped the hype over id4 . \nit promises to be the summer film of the year and it has all the elements necessary . \nid4 opened in the us on 2nd of july , and up till now , only after a week of release , it has nearly touched the us$100 million mark , a phenomenon last observed when jurassic park was released back in 1993 . \nthe premise of the movie is disgustingly simple : earth defends itself against the aliens , a typical and highly popular 50\'s hollywood theme which manifested itself in many films produced in that era . \nthe movie opens via star wars , however unoriginal it may be , it worked . \nthe aliens have sent a large mother ship ( supposedly to be 1/4 size of the moon ) to attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles in radius to all the major cities on earth . \nthe us president ( pullman ) does not know of the aliens\' intention but soon finds out when david ( goldblum ) a scientist , discovers that the aliens are counting down to a synchronised attack on all the major cities . \ncapt . hiller ( smith ) , a hot-shot f-18 pilot are one of the hundreds assigned to take out the hovering alien attack ship over washington dc . \nhis squadron came under heavy alien fire after discovering that their weapons were useless against the invaders , he crash lands after a spectacular 1-on-1 chase over the grand canyon , one of the many highlights of the movie . \nid4 features many characters and we are shown the impact on them as the story progresses . \nacting on the whole was ok although i thought that bill pullman was a bit unsuitable for the president role but he did make a very rousing speech before sending his troops into battle ( do we smell a bit of braveheart here ? ? ) . \nno prizes for guessing how id4 ends , its just plain obvious . \nid4 borrows heavily from star wars , return of the jedi , alien and in some parts of the movie , i could even sense a bit of x-files on screen . \nif i were to critically review this movie , id4 is full of plot holes , corny dialogue , and ridiculously dumb aliens . \nhowever below that wafer-thin plot and on-screen flaws , id4 scored well in playing with the appealing idea of the entire world giving up their petty differences to unite themselves as one force against the alien invasion . \nan idea which will have the audience strongly rooting for the united front throughout the movie , thus maintaining a screen-viewer interaction that virtually render any holes in the movie acceptable , no matter how ridiculous . \nid4 was produced under a modest budget of us$68 million , a film of such magnitude would have easily been another waterworld but director roland emmerich ( universal soldier , stargate ) and producer dean devlin assembled a team which did their own special effects rather than commissioning it to ilm or any other special effects company . \nsome of the effects are not too good but most of it are very believable , especially the epic standoff between 150 f-18\'s and 250 alien saucers , reminiscence of the classic space battle featured in return of the jedi . \nid4 is a movie for all . \nthough there are many explosions and implied deaths , there are no gory scenes of human destruction , thus young kids should be able to take it . \nsit back and don\'t be too critical , chances are you will be absorbed into the movie just as i was . \nif you are not planning to watch any movies this year , please , at least make time for this one . \nthis film is best watched on the big-screen . \n'
?,'the trailers and the beginning of the move sum up this plot very easily . \nthree filmmakers venture into the woods of maryland to track down the legend of the blair witch for a documentary they are making . \nthey disappear and their footage is discovered a year later buried underneath the foundation of a one hundred year old house . \nfrom there , things become a little more complicated . \ni can say , with absolute assurance , that no film has ever had quite the impact that this little movie has had on me . \nalthough i know it was all a staged \" mockumentary \" , there\'s no denying the psychological impact this film will leave on you . \ni didn\'t feel much upon initially watching it . \ni just thought it was an interesting film with some pretty creepy parts . \ni never even dreamed that thirty minutes after the film had ended i would be frightened out of my mind just discussing it with a friend . \ni\'ve gotten chills every time i\'ve brought it up since then . \nthis is not a movie that hits you right away . \ninstead this is a movie that sits at the base of your spine , waits until you think everything is okay , then it slowly starts to creep it\'s way up into your mind . \nthis is truly the most frightening movie i have ever had the pleasure to watch . \nthe film is comprised of home video and 16mm camera footage that the documentarians supposedly shot for their blair witch film , so don\'t expect any steadi-cam shots or fancy camera work . \nthis is as real as it gets folks . \ni don\'t recommend sitting too close to the theater screen though , because i guarantee you will get motion sickness from the constant movement of the camera . \nthe performances of the three lead actors in the film are so real , you may find yourself questioning whether all of this has really happened or not . \nthis is definitely a movie that warrants home video viewing , especially due to the fact that the bulk of the movie was shot with a standard home video camera . \nthe reality of the images will strike frighteningly close to home when viewed as actual video instead of the tape-to-film transfer done for the big screen . \nword has it that a special edition dvd with boatloads of extras ( hours of deleted scenes , alternate endings , commentary , the sci-fi channel special , and others ) is being planned for release . \ni urge artisan entertainment to forge ahead with this plan and give us what could be the dvd to rival all dvd\'s . \ni know i\'ll be first in line to buy one . \n[r] \n'

?,'sometimes i find 19th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to . \nit\'s not the time or the distance , it\'s the rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy . \nyet somehow , the movies are all well made and i always get caught up in the story . \nthe wings of the dove fits the pattern . \nkate ( helena bonham carter ) and merton ( linus roache ) are in love . \nmerton , a newspaper writer , would like to marry kate . \nbut kate\'s \" job \" , if you will , is to be a member of the british upper class . \nher father lost all of her family\'s money , but a wealthy aunt agreed to take care of her until she married a nice rich man . \nnaturally , a newspaper writer\'s wages don\'t count as \" rich . \" \nkate leads him on , but she always ends up giving him the cold shoulder , ultimately because he\'s not marriageable . \nkate\'s american friend millie ( alison elliot ) stops in for a visit on her way to venice . \nat a party , millie catches a glimpse of merton and likes what she sees . \nkate realizes that if merton were introduced to millie , he might forget about her . \nit appears that she is trying to spare him from the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup . \nmerton sees what kate is doing and resents her for it . \nhe is still in love with kate , and will accept no substitute . \nthe three of them , along with a fourth friend ( elizabeth mcgovern ) end up on holiday in venice together , where their interactions are quite complicated . \nlet\'s sum up : millie has fallen for merton . \nmerton has no feelings for millie because he is still in love with kate . \nkate loves him but can\'t marry him , so on the one hand she\'s trying to match him up with someone who will make him happy , but on the other hand she\'s jealous of them as a couple . \na clear solution presents itself to kate when she realizes that millie is very sick - dying , in fact . \nat this point she decides that merton should marry millie until she dies . \nmillie will leave her money to merton , who will then be rich enough to marry kate . \nshe lets merton know of her schemes and , since it will help him win kate , he reluctantly agrees . \nkate leaves venice so that the two m\'s can be alone together . \nmerton finds that pretending to love millie is a lot like actually loving her . \nhe\'s not sure he can separate the two . \nkate finds that she\'s not so sure she really wants her merton falling in love with and marrying anyone else . \nthe brilliant scheme proves to be painful to all involved . \nwithout revealing the details , suffice it to say that the situation ends badly . \nthe title refers to the object of merton\'s vain hope that something might lift him from his predicament . \none is left with feelings of regret and despair . \nwhat started as such a promising relationship was damaged by greed , anger , and jealousy . \nan interesting thought struck me after the movie was over , and that is that the wings of the dove almost fits the story line of a film noir . \na couple conspires to cheat someone out of their money so they can live happily ever after . \ntheir involvement in the deception makes each less attractive to the other , and after a few things go wrong , the whole idea seems like an awful life-ruining mistake . \ni wouldn\'t call the wings of the dove a film noir , but the comparison is interesting . \nas i have acknowledged before , i am not a wonderful judge of acting , but i liked the performances from roache and elliot . \nroache successfully conveyed his character\'s ambivalence toward millie : near the end , he hugs her , at first staring into space , as if he\'s thinking about his plan with kate , then giving that up to fully embrace millie . \nmillie\'s part didn\'t require as much range , but elliot gave her the necessary bubbly personality that made her irresistible . \ni will probably file away the wings of the dove in the same low-traffic corner of my mind as sense and sensibility and persuasion . \ntheir settings are far removed from my personal experience - geographically , historically , and socially . \nstill , the movies are well made and the stories inevitably win me over . \n'
?,'way of the gun is brimming with surprises , some good , most bad . \none of the good ones is ryan phillippe\'s surprisingly halfway decent performance . \nafter the actor gained much attention by posing and preening through teen swill like i know what you did last summer , he hinted at a bit growth in last year\'s cruel intentions with his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performance , though his acting in that film faltered around the third act mark , precisely when the screenplay made his character grow a heart ( presumably to appeal to his training bra wearing fans ) and start bellyaching about how he\'d fallen for his \" target \" . \nit was a dramatic shift that neither phillippe nor the film\'s director could negotiate . \nbut he seems to be trying and that shouldn\'t be overlooked ( or probably over praised ) seeing as how , at this point , he really isn\'t required to do much but look pretty . \nhere , phillippe has procured a five day growth of beard , his hair askew and his affect altered to sound something like james cagney in all his \" look here , see \" glory . \nit\'s tough to believe a pretty boy like phillippe as a hard ass , but his performance actually helps with the illusion . \nunlike ben affleck\'s puppy dog approach in reindeer games , phillippe is believable and not too bad at that . \nas for the plot , well , that\'s one of the bad surprises ; phillippe and the great benicio del torro play two moronic ( and not even remotely likeable ) criminals ( introduced to us in the parking lot of a rave where they stupidly pick a fight with about twenty people ) who hatch a scheme to kidnap a surrogate mother ( juliette lewis ) after overhearing that she\'s carrying the baby of painter ( scott wilson ) , a very well connected wealthy man . \nthe kidnapping devolves into a laborious shoot out where much damage is done and many are killed . \nbut the anti-heroes escape with the woman while an aging hit man ( james caan ) and two scheming bodyguards ( taye diggs and nicky katt ) remain in pursuit . \ndirected by christopher mcquarrie , the screenwriter who won an oscar for his work on usual suspects , an overrated piece of crime noir in many circles ( this one included ) , way of the gun is a hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs that just oozes eye rolling familiarity . \nunlike phillipe , mcquarrie doesn\'t seem to be growing at all ; he fills his flick with a sprawling labyrinth of plot all snatched from movies i know i\'ve seen before and worse , it feels like it . \nthe film lacks even a fresh approach ( like what soderbergh did out of sight or the limey ) to its clich ? s , all of which are spewed before us in a picture that tries so desperately to be hip and gritty without bothering to notice how common it is . \nit features characters living by a code they seemed to have picked up in sam peckinpah 101 rather than any thing resembling life . \neven attempts at emotional weight feel strained like in preposterous scene where enemies james caan and benicio del torro stop in their tracks to have a cup of coffee and pontificate on life , philosophy , etc . i didn\'t like the bit much when it first appeared in heat , here , it\'s even more self consciously \" dramatic \" . \nusual suspects , which also featured a bunch of low lives that seemed to live by a code they learned from the movies , worked to some degree because of that astonishing twist ending . \nnowadays an astonishing twist per ending is de rigeur , never mind if it deems all that transpired before it completely inconsequential . \nthus , nearly every character in way comes with at least one dirty little secret ( most amateurishly projected before they appear ) and it too has an ironic little twist at the end ( nothing earth shattering , like in the usual suspects ) but i admit , i didn\'t see it coming , and i smiled . \nhowever most of the movie feels exactly like the interrogation scenes between palminteri and spacey in usual suspects : a lot of faux huffing and puffing with no rhythm or reason . \nor substance . \nit\'s just as overplotted as suspects , and often dull as any overplotted movie without interesting characters , a distinctive style , or a good script would be . \neven the good stuff , most of which involves james caan ( doing a fine job ) , feels odd and out of place in a movie that thinks lines like \" karma is only justice with out the satisfaction \" are clever . \nat one point caan laments \" need is the ultimate monkey \" a line so inexplicable he might as well have said \" love is like hippo ass \" . \ni\'ve seen porno with better dialogue . \nand some with better plot lines too . \nbut rarely has porn offered up such a talented cast ( i mean , can you even compare james caan to ron jeremy ) . \ncaan slips into this role with seeming ease , he could do this kind of soft-spoken tough guy in a coma , but he manages to give his character depth and weariness . \nbenicio del torro is always welcome , though here he plays it fairly straight ( rather than another oddball character creation like the ones the actor gave us in usual suspects and excess baggage ) , adopting a brad pitt-esque quizzical pout to go along with his heavy swaggering . \nspeaking of pitt , his ex , juliette lewis , is a weak link , either shouting her lines with ear shattering shrillness , or waddling about like a silly goose . \nnicky katt was brilliant in a brief role in the limey , here his role is just as brief only he seems wasted ; he\'s only kept around for his cold presence . \ntaye diggs has a similar function , cool as ever , but never a character , though the guy has one helluva death scene . \nfor the most part way is incessantly talky with no reason to give a hippo\'s ass about any thing that transpires since its characters are never more than simplistic pawns . \nit\'s vaguely tarantino-ish , but in a bad truth and consequences nm way , with phillippe , in one scene , leaping into a stupid rant about \" faggots \" migrating to los angeles . \nyou know the routine . \nthe final shoot out is pure bargain basement john woo ( who himself seems to be doing bargain basement john woo ) with interchangeable bad guys lining up to be shot at . \nbut those gun shots sure crack like thunder . \njust the other day i was watching an old dirty harry movie on cable and was stunned to hear the weak elephant grunt-like sound that emanated from harry\'s fetishized smith and wesson . \noh how far we\'ve come . \n'

?,'adam sandler turns up the charm in his latest romantic comedy , the wedding singer . \nunfortunately , that also has the effect of softening his edge . \nhe\'s nowhere near his peak of happy gilmore , not that it was much of one . \nhe\'s certainly not helped here by a rather frail plot . \nthe year is 1985 , letting the whole film obsess with 80s nostalgia . \nadam sandler is nice guy robbie , the titular wedding singer , who entertains at the local reception hall by belting out his interpretations of classic 80s hits . \nrobbie\'s life is thrown into turmoil when his fiancee , linda ( angela featherstone ) , leaves him at the altar . \nhowever , things are looking up when he meets julia ( drew barrymore ) , a waitress at the hall . \nshe\'s the perfect woman , but for one small flaw : she\'s engaged to be married to a slick junk bond king , glenn ( matthew glave ) . \nso , most of the film deals with the slow realization by robbie that he and julia are in love , and his attempts to stop the wedding . \nas far as plots go , it\'s a pretty thin and tired one . \nto fill the gaps , the wedding singer delivers heaping spoonfuls of 1980s nostalgia . \nfrom boy george to michael jackson , from miami vice to dallas , from the first cds to the last rubik\'s cubes , this film revels in all the minutiae . \nand then there\'s the music . . . \nlearning a lesson from the successful soundtracks to grosse pointe blank , and romy and michele\'s high school reunion , this film packs more 80s songs in the film than the running time will allow . \nas a result , most songs get maybe a lyric or a half , but you can almost see the bright gleam in the record executives\' eyes : the wedding singer vols . \n2 , 3 , and 4 ! \nwhile the nonstop 80s riffs get incredibly tiring , at least they distract you from the plot . \nat least last year\'s my best friend\'s wedding stirred up the standard \" keep your true love from marrying someone else \" plot by making the rival a nice person . \nhere , glenn is such a lowly rat of a man that you never see what julia saw in him . \nbarrymore , on the other hand , is simply charming as julia . \nwhich leaves us with adam sandler . \nhe\'s at his best in the film when his nice guy persona fades a little ( such as when he has a breakdown on stage during a wedding reception ) . \nwhen he\'s in full nice-guy mode , he\'s more pathetic than endearing . \nthe film boasts several cameos ( most notably by steve buscemi and jon lovitz ) . \nbut none of them work well at all . \nbuscemi\'s role as a drunken best man simply fails to be humorous . \nlovitz , on the other hand , as a rival wedding singer , makes you long for his good old days on saturday night live , where he was actually funny . \nthe only cameo which has some appeal is a guest appearance by a classic 80s rocker during the film\'s finale ( surprisingly , one of the only plot-related scenes which actually works . ) \nadam sandler still has some work to do before he can become a dependable leading man . \nwhile he attempts to change his image in the wedding singer , the end result is no net gain . \n'
?,'in the grand scheme of mel gibson movies , payback was better than conspiracy theory , but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon . \nin other words , it\'s a decent couple of hours of entertainment , but 20 years from now if a they compile a list of mel gibson\'s greatest hits , payback probably won\'t be on it . \ngibson plays a crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist a payroll . \nmel\'s partner needed the money to pay off a mob debt . \nso he puts a couple of bullets in mel , leaving him for dead , and goes on to pay off his creditors . \nbut , mel isn\'t dead ( it would be a real short movie if he was ) and he certainly isn\'t happy . \nto make matters worse , he wants his money back and is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this feat . \nhis ex partner has already used it to pay off the mobsters , so mel goes after the mob to get it back . \npayback is often a very violent film . \nto its credit , there are a few scenes that could have been very graphic , but the director ( i\'m not sure which one -- more about that in a second ) made the choice to let the audience use their imagination instead of subjecting us to the usual gratuitous gore found in many films . \nthe film appears a bit disjointed in places , which is understandable considering producer / star gibson wasn\'t thrilled with how the film turned out and wanted parts of it re-shot . \nwhen the director refused , another one was brought in to do the re-shoot . \nso as a result while the final product is apparently better than the original ( although personally i would love to see the original version for comparisons sake ) it does get a bit of a choppy feel to it towards the end . \nit\'s always tough to make a film where the main character is a villain , unless that person has some redeeming qualities . \nin this case , gibson\'s character has few redeeming qualities . \nbut hey , its mel , so even when he is killing people in cold blood we are still rooting for him . \nmy guess is that if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role , the audience would not be quite as responsive . \ngibson is gibson , whether he is playing a suicidal cop or a stone cold killer , he does a good job . \nhe almost guarantees that no matter what else happens in the rest of the movie at least the audience is going to get one good performance . \nthis time out mel is surrounded by a good supporting cast , including maria bello ( as his love interest ) , william devane and kris kristofferson ( as mod bosses ) . \nthe man who steals the show and unfortunately doesn\'t have a real big part is james coburn ( as yet another mobster ) . \nif i had one big disappointment in this film , it would be that coburn didn\'t have a bigger role . \nin the end , payback is a fairly solid action thriller , just not in quite the same league as some of mel gibson\'s other work . \n'
?,'i don\'t appreciate it when a thriller manipulates the viewer into thinking the plot is interesting , when in fact it\'s ludicrous . \nin the case of the general\'s daughter , the plot is more than capable of intriguing you to a certain point . \nbut at this juncture in the story , the movie begins to fall apart like a crumbling cookie . \nthis predictable summer thriller is only sporadically involving , and that is unfortunately not enough to compensate for all of it\'s detailed flaws . \nget past one moment early on where john travolta exercises his southern accent , and you\'re likely to survive this entire movie . \ntravolta plays criminal investigations divisions officer paul brenner , who\'s working undercover at a military base when another situation arises : the apparent rape and murder of a young female officer ( leslie stefanson ) . \nit turns out that the victim is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) . \nlet the investigation begin . \nwith the assistance of fellow cid investigator sarah sunhill ( played rather on-the-sidelines by madeleine stowe ) , brenner uncovers what appears to be an intricate and bizarre homicide case . \nthings begin to get marginally engrossing when we meet colonel moore ( james woods ) , a former commanding officer of the deceased who has a few secrets up his sleeve . \nwoods submits another scene-stealing performance here as he oozes authority , surrounded by clouds of smoke emitted from his cigar . \nwith echoes of his supporting role in true crime , in which he duked it out with clint eastwood in enjoyably profane verbal exchanges , he makes every moment believable . \nhere though , the intense dialogue comes care of confrontations with travolta , as the two send mindful , knowing glares across the room . \nthere are many scenes such as this in the general\'s daughter , in which the veteran cast performs splendidly under pressure , but the circumstances that tie these meetings together are difficult to absorb . \ndirector simon west ( con air ) , shows a watchful eye of delivering a stylish looking thriller , but he fails miserably when it comes to the intellectual part of it . \nthe general\'s daughter is , more often than not , a predictable and unexciting mess . \nit does not help matters that the plot is virtually actionless , dragging it\'s heels all the way at a mind-numbing snails pace . \na few brief action scenes , marvelously handled in the editing department , show that the movie could have delivered such a more proficient package . \nfrom a director who does such a great job of staging explosions and miraculous stunts , i suggest west should stick with mindless , rip-roaring action features and attempt to avoid future projects like this . \nstill , the movie is certainly not without it\'s merits . \nthe acting is very good from the majority of the experienced cast . \nthe performances range from commanding ( travolta ) to electric ( woods ) to stiff-as-a-board ( cromwell , who doesn\'t show off his real talents here ) . \nmadeleine stowe manages to hold her own for a while , but as the female lead in an action-thriller , she doesn\'t pull through sufficiently . \none of the problems with the execution is that it\'s very predictable . \n>from minute one , i had few doubts about the identity of the killer in question . \nthe script even unwillingly points him out for us , using familiar techniques to hide his guilt until the unmasking toward the end . \nin all fairness , we\'ve seen many of the devices used in the general\'s daughter put to greater effect in other films . \nthe secrets behind the girl\'s mysterious death are explained gradually , but by the resolution we have tunneled through so much malarkey that it feels unnecessary and surprisingly silly . \nthe general\'s daughter is not a terrible movie , and it is involving enough to sustain a viewer\'s attention span for a certain period of time . \nbut it just could have been so much better . \n'

?,'the blues brothers was a wonderful film , a hilarious comedy packed with good music . \nit cried out for a sequel , but john belushi\'s untimely death seemed to eliminate the idea . \nhowever , eighteen years have passed , and the long dormant sequel has finally emerged . \nunfortunately , it\'s a sequel not worthy of the original . \nthe film starts exactly eighteen years after the first one ended . \nelwood blues ( dan aykroyd ) is just getting out of jail , his brother jake having recently died . \nas in the first film , he first visits mother mary stigmata ( kathleen freeman ) and then sets about getting the band back together . \njohn belushi\'s absence leaves a terrible hole in the film , and although three new characters are created to fill the void , it is still very noticeable . \nfirst , there\'s cabel ( joe morton ) the illegitimate son of elwood\'s stepfather ( played by cab calloway in the first movie ) . \ncabel is reluctant to join his destiny , and spends most of the movie as an illinois sheriff , chasing the blues brothers band . \nnext , there\'s mighty mack ( john goodman ) , a bartender who becomes the new lead singer of the band . \nfinally , there\'s buster ( j . \nevan bonifant ) , a ten year old orphan who tags along with elwood and eventually joins the band . \nthe plotting of the film is hardly original . . . it \nseems to be almost a clone of the original . \nelwood has to go to reluctantly retrieve each member of the band , they then travel , while being pursued by the police , and perform at several odd stops until they finally reach the big concert finale . \nthe first film had neo-nazis as the random element , this time around , the russian mafia and a militia group fill their role . \nin fact , the duplication of the plot is so ridiculously complete that certain scenes are practically identical to the original . \nremember the classic performance at country bob\'s ( where they like both types of music : country and western ) from the first movie ? \nwell , this movie has a performance at a country fair , where the band is expected to play bluegrass music . \nthere\'s the massive police car pileup , although this time the gag falls completely flat . \nthere\'s even an exact replica of the conversion scene in the church of reverend cleophus ( james brown ) . \nthere are plenty of recurring characters too . \nin addition to mother stigmata and reverend cleophus , aretha franklin reprises her role as mrs . murphy . \nfrank oz , a prison guard in the first film , makes an appearance here as the prison warden . \nas the stars , the new blues brothers don\'t live up to their legacy . \naykroyd is more loquacious , yet much flatter as elwood . \njohn goodman barely has a character as mighty mack . \njoe morton has the deepest character , but not a terribly interesting one , as cab . \nand what\'s the deal with the orphan ? \nit plays like a desperate gimmick that doesn\'t mesh at all with the rest of the film . \nat least bonifant isn\'t as precocious as he could have been in the role . \nbut the true star , and the only saving grace , of the film is the music . \nand the film is packed with it ( even during and after the ending credits ) . \nalthough there are no brilliant mergers of comedy and song as in the original\'s rawhide/stand by your man medley , the music is very much enjoyable . \nto top it off , the film is packed to the gills with cameo musician appearances . \nb . b . king , blues traveler , eric clapton , travis tritt , wilson pickett , erykah badu , bo diddley and steve winwood are just a sampling of the multitude of stars that make an appearance here and there . \nunfortunately , the music pauses here and there to allow in the familiar plot . \nif simply copying the original blues brothers wasn\'t bad enough , writers aykroyd and john landis dumb it down , removing any memorable characters , and replacing them with flashy , but unbelievable , magical gimmicks . \nit\'s a shame . \nbuy the soundtrack and avoid the film . \nbetter yet , rewatch the original . . . you\'ll \nhave a much better time . \n'
?,'well , what are you going to expect ? \nit\'s a movie about a big snake that eats people . \nthat\'s what i should have been thinking when i viewed this film , because maybe then i would have enjoyed myself more . \ninstead , i ended up wishing a giant snake would come along and eat me , too . \nanaconda is about a documentary film crew sailing down a south american river . \nled by anthropologists dr . steven cale ( eric stolz ) and terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) , the crew is attempting to locate a lost tribe of natives . \nalong the way , they find poacher paul sarone ( jon voight ) , and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda . \nto simply say that this is the world\'s largest snake wouldn\'t be doing it justice , since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide . \nif this isn\'t a good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers , i don\'t know what is . \nat the beginning of anaconda , we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past , but that seems to be more or less over now . \ni expected that fact to play a key part somewhere down the line , but it ended up being a set-up for nothing . \ncale chokes on a deadly wasp ( don\'t ask me how that happens - i don\'t know ) and is put out of action , relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help . \nthis minimally helps to add a sense of urgency for the plot , since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarone\'s plan to capture the snake . \nhowever , this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film , and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle . \nmost bad characters are either annoying or stupid . \nin this movie , they\'re both . \nsince this description applies to all the characters except sarone , it\'s hard to find someone to root for . \nyou\'re supposed to back the good guys , but you really end up cheering for sarone because he\'s smarter than everyone else . \nor maybe he\'s just not as dumb as everyone else . \nat times , i almost found myself rooting for the snake . \nthere are no standout performances here . \neveryone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters . \neven voight appears to be doing his best impression of christopher walken for some reason . \nno matter , as in most monster movies , the snake is supposed to be the real star anyway . \nin most of the scenes , the snake is computer generated , and the effects crew did a decent job of making it look real . \nhowever , the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic occurrences . \nsometimes , for example , the snake just moves too fast . \nit catches a guy jumping off of a waterfall , for crying out loud . \nthen there\'s another scene where the snake eats one of the characters , and we see the snake\'s skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victim\'s pained expression from within the snake\'s belly . \nabsolutely ridiculous . \na testimony to the film\'s bad direction is the inclusion of a scene early on the in the film , where we get to see just how dangerous the mighty anaconda is . \nin a scene totally unrelated to anything else , we are witness to the big snake winning a showdown with a panther . \nthe anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were a stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard , one of the panther\'s eyeballs pops out . \neeeewwwww . \nabove and beyond the sick factor , however , this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before a quarter of the movie had even passed . \nin films like these , a sense of mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained . \nif the characters are reacting to something they fear more than see , we as an audience must experience that feeling along with them . \nto show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters don\'t know about , and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown . \nin a case like that , the showdown just ends up being a letdown . \nwhen i saw the snake for the first time , i decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume that the snake i saw wasn\'t the real danger . \nthis one was just a decoy , and there was actually a bigger snake waiting to make its appearance just when everyone thought they were safe . \nno such luck . \nokay , maybe anaconda is actually a decoy , and there\'s really a better movie waiting to make its debut . \n'

) . \nso back we are , with ripley back as a clone , which means we get another little satirical look at cloning ( not that that\'s a bad thing , but it\'s becoming a cliche ) . \nso she\'s cloned aboard an even more futuristic-looking ship called \" the auriga \" by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy , dr . wren , played by j . e . freeman , as well as the little-seen dr . gediman , played by none other than brad douriff ) , mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her . \nonce you get past the fact that you can\'t figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one ) , the film\'s okay . \nalso on board are a band of mercenary pirates , including michael wincott , ron perlman , kim flowers , raymond cruz , dominique pinon ( a jeunet sytable ) and . . . winona ryder , who plays analee call , who turns out to have a bit of a secret ( i won\'t state it , but unless you\'ve been shacking up with salinger for the past two years , you probably know all about it - although it\'s nicely covered up ) . \nthere\'s a bit of a non-sexual-yet-slightly-homoerotic relationship between her and ripley , but it\'s never really deepened enough . \noh well . \nwell , as you might have guessed , the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship . \nand it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship ( including some shocks - dan hedaya , for instance , who\'s death is comical yet sad since , well , he\'s dan hedaya ) , and the remaining people ( about 7 or 8 ) are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth . \nof course , the plot is all balderdash , and just an excuse for some good old \" alien \" -brand fun . \nthe real focus of the series seems to be on style , not really substance ( although there\'s always a bit of it , most notably in \" aliens \" with the relationship between ripley and the little girl ) . \nwhat\'s interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach . \n \" alien \" is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights . \n \" aliens \" is a wild , tense thriller . \n \" alien 3 \" is a bleak , moody piece of semi-noir . \n \" alien 4 \" is kind of like an off-beat french film , filled with lots of humor , and cool scares . \njean-pierre jeunet ( without his usual directing partner , marc caro ) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like \" das boot \" has , with echoes hinting at a possible threat . \nthe chills in the film are really cool , especially with the music , which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes ( there\'s the most tense surgery scene since \" face/off \" towards the beginning ) . \nand not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that . \nthis all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others . \nthere are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed . \none is the aforementioned surgery scene . \nanother one takes place between call and ripley , which is just awesome . \nthe underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense , thrilling , and jaw-dropping scenes in the entire saga ( with a small allusion to jeunet\'s earlier film , \" delicatessen \" ) . \nand the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool ( with a lovely allusion to \" goldfinger \" ) . \nbut the best scene in the entire film ( i\'m sure i\'m not the first to mention it ) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her ( she has a an \" 8 \" tatooed on her arm ) . \nit might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga . \nthe screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work , as it never really deapens a lot of the characters . \nhowever , it does make us care about most of them , so that when there\'s very little of them , and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow , we are pretty scared . \nand , yeah , there are some very funny lines ( ripley : \" who do i have to fuck to get off this boat ? ! \" \njohner : \" well , i can get you off . \nbut not this ship . \" ) \nthe acting is good all around , with stand-out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner , and leland orser ( the poor bastad in \" se7en \" who performed the \" lust \" sin ) as an anxiety-ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him . \nwinona ryder is good , but not amazing like she usually is ( although she meshes well with the film ) . \nof course , and as usual , sigourney weaver steals the show . \nplaying a variation on the ripley character ( less emotional , and more rude and bitter ) , she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable . \nshe\'s not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for \" aliens , \" but she\'s just awesome . \noverall , it\'s a thrilling , entertaining film which doesn\'t really amaze like the first two , but is much more amazing than the third installment . \nthe style is the best part of the film , which isn\'t really a bad thing , but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply . \nbut it\'s entertaining as hell , and it\'s definitely fit for the \" alien \" series . \n'
?,'not since 1996\'s shine , which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott , has a movie so defiantly laid bare the lives of world-class musicians . \nin fact , if one were to watch these films together , it would almost certainly stand as a convincing argument that a life of music naturally leads to all varieties of social ills . \nyet hilary and jackie , the sophomore effort from director anand tucker , has something more to say -- it softly but strongly explores the complex relationships of sibling rivalry and love in a very compelling tale . \nemily watson and rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale , playing the sisters du pr ? . \nboth musicians from childhood , hilary ( griffiths ) is renowned flutist while jacqueline ( watson ) is easily as skilled on the cello . \nthe two comepete for and win many honors as children and as young women , both together and seperate . \ntheir careers as musicians surpass and then bow to one another\'s , and although their lives take very different paths -- hilary settles down to marriage and a family while rachel skips across the globe on a world concert tour -- they are bound together by their deep family love . \nthe performances of watson and griffiths are excellent in style and substance . \nthey contrast each other wonderfully , and while watson\'s portrayal of jackie du pr ? is at times eccentric and perhaps unsympathetic , both characters are charged with emotion . \nthe frank cottrell boyce script , which is based on the book by hilary and piers du pr ? , brings a great deal of depth to these characters as well . \nthe script is also to be commended for its well-polished dual nature . \ncottrell boyce adopts a style which one might expect to see in a mystery thriller ( which was in fact the case with david koepp and robert towne\'s script for mission : impossible ) and skillfully molds it to the story of two rising musicians on different courses to fame . \nthe latter parts of his script are controversial to say the least , and the rather depressing ending takes the wind out of an envigorating story . \nsome will leave this movie feeling disenfranchised . \nnevertheless , hilary and jackie is a movie that reaches an upper echelon of contemporary cinema through solid fundamentals and is a decent watch all around . \n'
?,'luckily , some people got starship troopers . \nsome people knew it was supposed to be silly . \nfor those of you who didn\'t , how could you miss it ? \nfrom the very beginning , when we see an interactive internet-like promotional video for the armed forces of the future , it should be obvious this film is to be taken lightly . \ni guess without blatant one-liners and home alone style slapstick , some people just don\'t recognize such goofy humor . \nsuch a dry approach to such intentionally campy humor must have left some disillusioned . \nfirst thing to do before seeing this movie - lighten up . \nmeet the equivalent of \" beverly hills 90210 \" meets \" mighty morphin power rangers \" . \nfour close friends are now graduating high school and are ready to join the armed forces , which , in the future , means fighting for the whole galaxy and not just your country . \njohnny rico ( casper van dien ) is ready to join the infantry , mostly because his girlfriend carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) has enlisted to be a pilot . \ndizzy flores ( dina meyer ) has enlisted as a trooper , and it\'s possible she\'s joining merely to follow rico , whom she\'s always had eyes for . \nif you saw these three on the street , you\'d automatically start searching for the fashion designers and photographers , for never has a movie\'s cast looked so much like the cut-out cover of \" seventeen \" magazine . \nthe lone non-supermodel , carl jenkins ( played by doogie howser himself , neil patrick harris ) is the brainiac who gets into the military intelligence division , the top secret department that pretty much leaves doogie - er , carl out of the picture . \n ( good call - now we can put all our drooling efforts into only the most deserving of characters ) . \nright off the bat , rico becomes the star of the show , far surpassing all the other soldiers and becoming squadron leader in a short period of time . \nbut a horrific accident during a standard training exercise ( which follows all to closely to his breakup with carmen ) leaves rico ready to call it quits . \nwith his bags packed and his civilian clothes back on , johnny is ready to walk off base and catch the next flight home . \nwell sorry , rico suave , but there\'s no place like home , especially after gigantic alien insects have destroyed it . \nthat\'s right , the planet is being attacked by a colony of arachnid-like alien beings that a can of raid just isn\'t going to destroy . \nwith a sudden change of heart ( and clothes ) , rico is back in the game , following his fellow starship troopers off to fight a mean group of daddy long legs . \nwhat starship troopers really is , is a spoof of all that it even remotely touches on - the soap opera like love affairs of high school , the love for sci-fi and thirst for gore shared by this same age group , etc . nothing is taken seriously . \nit\'s almost as much a satire on young adults as clueless , but with its sly and futuristic approach , it\'s not as recognizably so . \nit\'s a spoof so subtle that many won\'t recognize the spoofery . \nif you deem this as sci-fi/action , you\'re wrong . \nit\'s sci-fi/action/comedy , with the comedy being on the level of such cult favorites as evil dead 2 . starship troopers just may be on the road to cult status as well . \ngore is a factor heavily brought up in reviews of this film , but the gore , too , is meant to be cheesy . \nyes , it\'s graphic , but it\'s also brutally phony , and that\'s what makes it such great fun to watch . \nnot since the old \" mr . bill \" skits on \" saturday night live \" has torture and mutilation been such a joy to watch . \npeople were laughing out loud every time a body was severed in half or a head was viciously decapitated . \nperhaps it brings back fond memories of the severities we inflicted upon our sisters\' barbie dolls as young children . \nwith the actors resembling ken and barbie so closely , it\'s a good chance this is the case , whether we\'re fully aware of it or not . \nstarship troopers has it\'s slow parts , but it\'s truly an alternative to your typical sci-fi/action flick or lame juvenile comedy . \naside from the intentionally cheesy gore , the special effects are quite astounding . \nwhen the spaceship passes a meteor , it\'s quite an awesome spectacle , visually crisp and captivating . \nif you\'re looking for brainless fun , this is the epitome of your search . \na beautiful cast , awesome special effects , fast-paced action , campy acting , and a whole lot of gore . \nthis is brainless heaven . \njust remember not to think . \n'
?,'terrence malick made an excellent 90 minute film adaptation of james jones\' world war ii novel . \nunfortunately , he buried it within an overlong and overreaching 3-hour long pseudo-epic . \nthis is a shame because the film features an outstanding performance by nick nolte . \nthe best scene is when nick nolte\'s character , lt . col . tall , is forced to deal with the direct refusal by capt . staros ( elias koteas ) to execute an order . \nnolte\'s reaction and transformation may be the best work of his career . \nhad terrence malick concentrated on the great performances of nolte and koteas as well as those by sean penn , woody harrelson , and john cusack , he could have made a truly great film . \ninstead , malick saddled the film with plodding pacing , unnecessary flashbacks , and a voice-over narration all designed to telegraph the great philosophical underpinnings of the story . \nthe narration was especially annoying as much of it sounded like very bad high school poetry . \nwith a lot of editing , the core story could be transformed into a truly classic war film . \nhopefully , the dvd version of this film will feature options to suppress the narration , and perhaps will even provide for an alternate , shorter version of the film . \ni give this film . \n'
?,'when i was growing up in 1970s , boys in my school used to divide into two groups , based on their action movies preferences . \nthe first one , myself included , liked movies that featured spectacular car chases , lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions . \nthe latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks , probably because they could ( or , to be more precise , thought they could ) imitate its stunts in the real life . \ndecades later , while refining my own cinematic taste , i began to appreciate and actually like those movies , probably because of overexposure to shoot-em-up idiocy of 1980s ramboids . \nyes , most of the kung fu and other \" martial arts \" flicks were cheap , they had predictable and formulaic plot , and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills . \nbut , in the same time , those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation . \nthe best of those movies , one that passed the test of time and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon . \nmade in 1973 in a joint hong kong - hollywood venture , it was intended to bring bruce lee\'s skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience . \nit succeeded , but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor . \nlee plays a quiet shaolin monk who is a martial arts expert . \nhe is approached by interpol official who asks him to join tri-annual martial arts tournament that is held on a remote island , owned and controlled by han , renegade shaolin monk . \ninterpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics , gun-running and prostitution operations and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to intervene . \nlee accepts the mission because of personal reasons - o\'harra , han\'s brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of lee\'s sister years ago . \nthe island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us - williams ( played by jim kelly ) is black activist running from the racist police , and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts . \nthe plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond ( the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later ) . \nthe main hero was faced against a power-hungry megalomaniac on a remote island , alone against whole army of bad guys . \non the other hand , lee was more believable hero than bond ; deprived of guns and super-tech gadgets , he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive . \nin the same time , the plot , although extremely thin , allowed him even some internal battles - between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own anti-violent philosophy . \nthe latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lee\'s acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence . \nalthough two other main actors - john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy - were intended to share top spot with lee , they served as nothing more than a comic relief . \nit is a real shame to see kelly , definitely the worse actor than saxon , to steal the scenes from him only because his lines , being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches , sound so damn over the top . \nother actors , not including shih kien who turns han into typical , although not very convincing bondian villain , are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee ( among them is young jackie chan ) . \nfighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago , although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre . \nin many way they are also more realistic ( they were personally staged by lee himself ) , demanding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent . \ni\'m not a martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan , but comparing those scenes with typical scenes today i simply can\'t avoid to appreciate the difference from today\'s movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor and win in the end . \nso , despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top 100 of all times , enter the dragon is a incredibly entertaining piece of cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who don\'t like that particular genre . \n'
?,' * * * the following review contains some harsh language . . . \nbut what did you expect when you clicked on this title ? \n * * * \ncast : kristen holly smith , danica sheridan , alex boling , michael dotson , sonya hensley , janet krajeski , sabrina lu , dionysius burbano , calvin grant , jeff b . harmon written and directed by : jeff b . harmon running time : 97 minutes \n \" the thought of losing you makes me all vomity inside . \" \n--- blatz balinski ( danica sheridan ) laments the fact that her lesbian lover , april ( kristen holly smith ) , has just received a telegram from her ex-fiance . \nisle of lesbos is an incredibly offensive musical comedy about april pfferpot ( smith ) , a resident of the small town of bumfuck , arkansas who is about to get married to high school sweetheart and football hero dick dickson ( michael dotson ) . \nwhen april gets extreme cold feet she runs home , sticks a gun in her mouth , and pulls the trigger . \ninstead of killing herself , she is magically transported through her mirror into the isle of lesbos , an alternate dimension where lesbians rule and no men are allowed ( except for lance , the homosexual toilet cleaner/slave ) . \napril loves her new home and friends , but dick and her parents are not so ready to give her up . \nmr . and ms . pfferpot ( director jeff b . harmon and janet krajeski ) decide they need medical help so they enlist the aid of dr . sigmoid colon ( also jeff b . harmon ) , who claims he can cure homosexuality . \nin actuality , dr . colon is homosexual as well and begins his special \" treatment \" on dick dickson ( unbeknownst to dick ) . \nwhen april turns down dick\'s demand for her to return to bumfuck , he decides to take matters in his own hands and attack the isle of lesbos rambo-style . \ninstead of leveling the place he falls in love with lance ( alex boling ) and the two of them , along with april and her lover blatz , get married . \n ( note to the filmmaker : why did the character of lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that i\'m assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided ? ) \napril\'s parents , feeling like there is no recourse , call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb ( whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer ) their way . \nthe bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the \" circuitry \" and they re-wire it and send it back to washington d . c . , destroying it . \nmr . and ms . pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own . \ni\'m not sure if writer/director/co-star jeff b . harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs . \neither way , he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie . \nthe film opens with a preacher running a small african-american child out of town , and then later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan ( during a jaunty musical number ) , preceded by remarks about \" gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others , such as the jews \" . \nif harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be , then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film , but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i can\'t help but feel like he had some serious intent . \nas for the entire central theme of the movie , i\'m afraid that it\'s one that i just don\'t get . \ni tried to keep an open mind while watching it , but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes . \nit was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society . \nhow does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of non-acceptance ? \ni\'m not prone to judging anyone and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society , but don\'t force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren\'t going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me . \nagain , maybe i\'m missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make , but if so , i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully . \nas far as musical comedies go , isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical , but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy . \ndespite the disturbing visuals , \" mom and apple pie \" stuck with me for the rest of the day . \nspeaking of disturbing visuals , \" wedding bells ain\'t ringing \" could have been a decent song , but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying . \n \" i\'m a lesbian \" ( which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular ) is also pretty good , but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms . smith . \nit\'s mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based . \nthe other performers are decent , save for the rosie o\'donnell like performance given by danica sheridan . \ni have no inherent problem with her character ; it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired . \none particular musical number , \" lesbian rock \" , was one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my film-going life thanks to a strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan . \nthe film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll . \nthe remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs ( \" lesbian rock \" included ) and the ridiculously presented anti-nukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it a feature length film . \nonce the \" isle of lesbos reprise \" was reached , i felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all . \nwhy was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end ? \nisle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www . indie-underground . com . \nthe transfer is pretty clean ( and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent ) and the film is letterboxed at approximately 1 . 85 : 1 . \nin many respects , isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential ( like a rocky horror for the new millennium ) . \nthis film is by no means my cup of tea , but i know there are those out there who will enjoy it . \nif you think it might be for you , then by all means seek it out . \ni , on the other hand , will be cleansing my palette with a good action film like gladiator . . . \nwait . aren\'t gladiator films considered to be . . . \noh , never mind . \n'
?,' \" take a number , fill out a form , and wait your turn . \" \nstarring kati outinen , kari v ? ? n ? nen , sakari kuosmanen , elina salo ; written & directed by aki kaurism ? ki ; cinematography by timo salminen \nit might be possible to call drifting clouds a satire or a black comedy , but that would imply a sense of anger , of vitriol , of energy ; drifting clouds is what you get when the rage and vitality are gone . \nit is the sad , slow story of lauri and ilona , a married couple caught between the wheels of capitalism as it grinds inexorably onward . \nhe loses his job as a tram driver , because everyone drives cars nowadays . \nwithin a couple of months , she loses her position as a head waiter , when her restaurant is bought out by a chain and the entire staff replaced . \na conversation early in the film reveals a lot about their situation . \nlauri has surprised ilona by buying her a tv , which she greets with little enthusiasm . \nshe notes that they haven\'t finished paying for the bookshelves or the couch yet . \nhe says that in four years the payments will be done and then they can buy some books for the shelves . \nit would pass as deadpan humour if it wasn\'t spoken with such resigned weariness . \nthis sets the tone for the rest of the movie . \nthere is humour and idiosyncracy at the periphery , but at the centre there is frustration and futility , and sorrow for the ways in which the logic of profit reduces people , until their worth is equated solely with their earning capacity . \nthere is an element of political commentary in this critique of the mechanisms of capitalism and the stultifying social environment it creates , but in drifting clouds the political is subsumed by the personal : the movie is about two people and what happens to them , and nothing else matters . \nlauri and ilona live lives starved for friendship , respect , culture , passion . \nthey go to the movies , and walk out past old posters for l\'atalante and l\'argent , but the movie they have just seen is a pointless , violent , unfunny comedy . \ntheir house and workplaces are uniformly unpleasant , painted and upholstered in lifeless colours ( ugly greens , dull reds , insipid blues ) , full of inelegantly functional objects and appliances . \nthe art design is impeccable in its tawdriness , and director aki kaurism ? ki often matches the colour of characters\' clothes with the background colour and/or lighting , so that it seems as if they are almost physically fading into the environment . \nthere is no suggestion of sexuality in the relationship ; ilona and lauri sleep in separate beds and their gestures of affection lack the heat of desire ; their lives are now bound by something more complex and desperate than love . \ntheir downward , downsized , downtrodden lives have a momentum that is almost comic , as one setback succeeds another , bottoming out when lauri stakes all their remaining money on the spin of a roulette wheel . \nit must have been tempting to play the story for more laughs , more farce , more deadpan wit , but the film\'s great strength is the sober , empathic manner in which it observes lauri and ilona\'s misfortunes . \nirony would be an injustice . \nsituations and settings are broad and exaggerated--this is not realism--but they are not distorted . \nthe emotions are authentic . \nif it is difficult to laugh at anything that happens , despite the droll performances , the laconic humour , that\'s because kaurism ? ki brings such compassion and understanding to the manifold indignities that are suffered . \nhe shows us how humiliating it must be for a woman of thirty-eight , who has worked long and hard to win a respectable position , to be forced to accept a job as a dishwasher in a two-bit restaurant ; how humiliating it must be for a man nearing 50 to confront his wife\'s former employer , demanding the rest of her wages , only to have the crap beaten out of him , unable to land a single punch , when the employer and his cronies refuse to give him the money . \nall this is observed keenly , with great economy : every cut , every line of dialogue , is judicious . \nif most films are novelistic in their telling , this one brings the focus and concentration of a short story to bear . \nbut what is gained in nuance and acumen is rather undermined by the sense that the material barely accommodates the 96-minute running length . \ni have seen many movies far less profound , less humane , less necessary than drifting clouds , but they filled me with an urge to watch them again , and this one did not . \nit does not need to be seen twice : its every detail and implication can be absorbed in one viewing . \nit is not a movie that will be seen by a large audience , because it cannot be pitched to one . \nthere is no selling point . \nit is all understatement , restraint , melancholy . \nthe characters are unremarkable , their best years behind them , their dreams dissipated ; it takes all the effort they can muster just to pay the bills . \nthis does not make them less fascinating , merely less marketable , which is a shame , because this is a movie which should be seen , precisely because it pays attention to people and emotions that most movies prefer to ignore . \nit engages us and touches us and resolves--surprisingly , and movingly--into something resembling a happy ending . \nthe only thing greater than the ill-luck that governs the characters\' lives is their refusal to give in to despair . \ntheir persistence is rewarded with what might be called a \" feel-good \" ending elsewhere , but not here , because this ending differs in kind from most such endings : this one has truly been earned . \n'

?,'imagine this scenario : you and any of your family members are scudding through one of those long , excruciating cross-country car trips , far from the city and into the deserted rural routes . \nso far , the trip is idyllic when , abruptly , your car malfunctions and you are stranded in the middle of nowhere . \nit is not an easy situation , but a perfectly plausible one , the panorama in which breakdown musters it\'s throbbing suspense and skillfully executed tautness . \nit is not easy to cobble a distinct and gripping thriller nowadays , but breakdown doesn\'t bungle into rudimentary plot holes or cliches and it derives a masterful , titillating climax that by it\'s finale , engrosses a viewer with total absorption . \nthe plot is somewhat reminiscent of 1988\'s the vanishing . \nkurt russell and kathleen quinlan respectively play jeff and amy taylor , a massachusetts couple en route to california for a brand new job . \nwhen they stop for gas somewhere in the arid southwest , jeff is confronted by a pugnacious driver , who later , will be an important player in the plot department . \nminutes later after that , their brand new , strikingly red , jeep grand cherokee unexpectedly stops . \njeff cannot detect the car\'s problem , so he allows amy to take a ride with red ( j . \nt walsh ) , a heedful truck driver who will convey her to the nearest town , where jeff will meet her at a local diner . \nit is facile for the film to turn into a pseudo-suspenser , but instead it opts for maximum fervor . \njeff manages to re-start the car himself , but when he arrives at the diner , she is nowhere in sight . \ndisconcerted , the coffee shop\'s bartender informs jeff where to search for his wife , a town about twenty miles from here . \nthere , trouble arises . \nand i shall not reveal anything else , since that would be spoiling the fun of what\'s head . \nthere are many involving , tight scenes in breakdown but the final climactic period which includes a magnificent chase with three cars and a huge truck , will have you feeling as if your legs are made out of pure foam . \nit is a pleasure to be part of a classic confrontation of good vs evil , and rooting for the good guys , in this case jeff . \nkurt russell is one of the few top-notch hollywood actors which doesn\'t overblow his acting , and gradually gains reliance on his role as it progresses . \nso you can assume his alteration in breakdown is letter-perfect . \nsuffice it is to say he undergoes a transformation , from a jolly man , to a guy frantically pursuing a loved one . \nnot many well-paid actors can deliver these type of performances , but russell is one of them . \nas an everyday man , he pulls it off extremely convincingly , what also surprised me more was his rigorous physicality , which he effectively practices almost all throughout the films 93 minutes . \nalthough the film is blotted with a couple of portentous action sequences ( very well done ) yet the tightness is generated by the subtle circumstances this man is presented with . \nfaced with an enigma about his wife\'s whereabouts , the movie succeeds by conveying us in realistic territory with veritable characters , including the cryptic villains , who in essence , make the movie what it is . \nwhat\'s most impressive however , is the feature debut by writer/director jonathan mostow . \nmostow , hitherto directed the showtime thriller flight of a black angle , alleviates the contrivances and generics of the script by gingerly pursuing the trajectory of the plot , efficiently letting the tone and the mood of the story generate that nail-biting suspense sought for in a well- made affair . \ncontrary to most american thrillers , he doesn\'t rely on visual flair , but on aesthetics and substance . \nafter breakdown , he should gain vast notoriety . \nthe villains in the movie aren\'t your routine out-of-this-world idiosyncratic psychos that are harming for no particular objective . \nthe baddies in breakdown , all well acted , are normal , seemingly inoffensive townspeople who beneath their trustworthy layer , conduct an amoral business of corruption and murder . \nthe movie smartly portrays these men as loathsome rednecks , and , of all things in the world , it is becoming rather easy to root for villains ( jon voight in anaconda ) in today\'s movies . \nworth a special mentioning is j . t walsh ( who previously worked with kurt russell in executive decision ) as the leader of the gang , he renders a deliciously wicked performance , temporarily stepping out of the minor roles he is known for . \nalfred hitchcock used suspense--and action-- not only to stimulate , but as a way of aiding his audience\'s fascination in his stories , which were slowly realizing man\'s biggest fears . \nbreakdown yields exactly that . \nit magnificently taps into the psyche of an ordinary man , acting like an ordinary man , looking like an ordinary and some sort of superhero . \ndespite one or two iffy moments even hitchcock , i think , would approve of breakdown . \n ( 1 : 33 ) \n'
?,'steve soderbergh\'s \" sex , lies , and videotape , \" which won the grand prize at the cannes film festival in 1989 , arguably began the resurgence of independent films . \nmade on a shoestring budget of $1 . 2 million , with then relatively unknown actors , it is a provocative , thoroughly original drama . \nthe film mostly focuses on the four central characters , all in their late 20\'s-early 30\'s . \nann ( andie macdowell ) , an unfulfilled housewife , is married to john ( peter gallagher ) , an insensitive lawyer , who , unbeknownst to her , is having an affair with her younger sister , cynthia ( laura san giacomo ) . \ncomplicating matters even worse is graham ( james spader , who won best actor at cannes ) , john\'s old college buddy , who comes to stay at their house . \nann is absolutely won over by him , even though she clearly has stated that she has very little interest in sex . \nthat is the set-up for the last hour of the picture , and since the film is entitled , \" sex , lies , and videotape , \" it is best to keep the rest of the story developments at bay so that they will come as a genuine surprise . \ndirector steven soderbergh has proven to be a wildly offbeat filmmaker , ranging from the independent , to the mainstream ( 1998\'s \" out of sight \" ) , to the downright kafkaesque ( 1997\'s \" schizopolis \" ) . \nhe is the type of director who obviously takes a lot of chances , and believes in the work that he does , and , \" sex , lies , and videotape , \" is probably his most confident , and maybe even best , to date . \nthe performances are superb from all four leads , but macdowell stands out in what is probably the main character . \nshe is always a very winning actress , but this is probably her most three-dimensional role that she has had ( with a close second being altman\'s 1993 mosaic , \" short cuts \" ) . \nthe other parts are perfectly cast as well , from spader\'s ominous graham , to gallagher\'s self-involved john , to giacomo\'s outspoken cynthia . \nthe final act of the film , especially , comes right out of left field , and turns out to be both shocking and oddly touching , and it would be criminal to give away the film\'s secrets . \nsuffice to say that , through one powerful sequence , ann is able to somewhat come out of her shell , and john learns a valuable lesson about honesty , as well as deception . \nthe film has one fault , however . \nthe characters are almost all emotionally cold and isolated from one another , and often unlikable . \nif there had been a few extra scenes with gallagher , it probably would have helped , since his relationship with macdowell isn\'t quite as explored as i would have liked . \n \" sex , lies , and videotape , \" although minorly flawed , is still easily a brave and adult motion picture that is far more mature and honest about its subject matter than the usual film . \nsoderbergh clearly knew what he was doing while he was making it , and the final product certainly proves this . \n'

?,'steven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities , because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits , like jurassic park , and \" oscar \" -awarded critical triumphs like schindler\'s list . \nhowever , in the 1970s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories . \none of them is close encounters of the third kind , extremely popular and influential science-fiction spectacle . \nunfortunately , it had a bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars . \nalthough both films have a lot in common ( ground-breaking special effects , brilliant score by john williams ) their future was different ; one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon , and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in its shadow . \nwhen spielberg began work on that project , he was already established as a bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit , jaws . \ntogether with other young directors of his \" new hollywood \" generation , like kauffman , carpenter , hill and millius , he exploited the great creative freedom of 1970s , when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment . \nironically , it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of \" blockubuster \" philosophy . \nbut in the mid 1970s , many things were different ; spielberg was young and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic movie . \nalthough very personal , spielberg\'s screenplay was partly based on the book \" ufo experience \" by dr . j . allen hynek and in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors to earth that began to grow in the world after ww2 . \nspielberg was not only inspired by the mythology , but his movie also gave the mythology itself a huge boost , unmatched until the contemporary era of x-files and the roswell anniversary . \nthat was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic ufo-related incidents as the element of the plot . \nthe story begins with one of such incidents - team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the u . s . navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight 19 . \nsuch events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary ( richard dreyfuss ) , power company worker from muncie , indiana , who later becomes obsessed with his experience . \nbecause of his obsession he loses his job , family and sanity , but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler ( melinda dillon ) , single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction . \nin the meantime , the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space and u . s . government , in co-operation with the french , led by lacombe ( francois truffaut ) begin with the preparation for ultra-secret project . \nwhen the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary , he finally sees some sense in all his visions and begins the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area . \nthere he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions . \ntwo of them must break through military pickets and reach their destination to find whatever is there . \nspielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects . \nthe slow , gradual yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents - \" close encounters \" - is set in order to bring the viewer to the great revelation in the finale . \nbut , instead of the fear and horror we had to endure during the jaws , we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder . \nthroughout the movie the viewer knows that something big , magnificent and wonderful is about to happen , and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in the end . \nthe last sequence , with its , even in this age , impressive special effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull , would leave many mouths open . \none of the great virtues of this film is its optimism . \naliens , who almost always get portrayed as the monsters in science-fiction cinema , are here benevolent and harmless creatures and the first contact between them and humanity is a beginning of something wonderful . \nit is very ironic , when we consider that the two classic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story - howard hawks\' thing and byron haskin\'s war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind . \nspielberg\'s humane approach and faith in the future also lies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era ; the only hint of the contemporary gloom is post-watergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the public . \nbut , even such government is much more harmless compared to the murderous and chain-smoking men in black that became the stereotype thanks to x-files and its more cynical and disturbing visions . \nthere lies the main , and probably the only flaw of this great picture - lack of conflict , and consequently , lack of drama . \nthe movie has few excitements or even action scenes ( especially the last that may be an interesting homage to hitchcock\'s north by northwest ) but generally , almost everyone - neary , jillian , government , aliens - are the good guys . \ndespite such shortcomings , the actors were good and manage to bring multidimensionality to their simple roles . \nrichard dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary , yet nice guy , who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in a grand finale . \nmelinda dillon was , on the other hand , nominated for \" oscar \" as a struggling mother , yet she was overshadowed by teri garr as neary\'s long-suffering wife ronnie . \napart from visual wonders of this film , spielberg\'s semi-official composer john williams again excels by his beautiful music , this time using the simple melody both as the element of a plot , and as the basis for his score . \nthe aliens , who are the main subject of this film , were visually very convincing . \ntoo convincing , one of my acquaintances in the ufo-researching circles said . \naccording to him , the depiction of extraterrestrials as grey-skinned little people with big eyes was so accurate , that it managed to freak out powerful government figures interested in suppressing the truth about ufos . \nso , they later approached spielberg and ordered him to make another movie with alien , this time designed to be anything but the real life . \nthe result was e . t . , for many years the biggest commercial hit of all times , yet less inspirational for ufo enthusiasts . \nanyway , whether the viewer believes in existence of extraterrestrials or ufos , close encounters of the third kind remains the great movie , and one of the rare uplifting experiences in modern cinema . \n'
?,'every year--every year at the festival , i wait for that film to come along , that one that just pulls me out of my seat , sticks its face up next to my nose , and roars \" sur-prise ! \" \ninto my bewildered visage . \nit\'s almost always a surprise . \nit sure as niflheim was this time . \namazing grace and chuck is being advertised as a modern fairy tale , of a boy in montana who quits his little league team for a very unusual reason . \nand , in the hands of anyone less careful than the creative staff of this film , it might very well be nothing more than a fairy tale , where we roll our eyes occasionally , smirk to ourselves , and maybe get a forced tear out of the eyes and a \" boy , i wish that could happen \" sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theater and tossing the empty pepsi cup into the trash . \nanother e . t . \nanother short circuit . \nthis film floored me , for the simple reason that while it has a fairy tale concept , the rest of the film takes itself seriously enough , and presents itself well enough , to make it more of an american folk tale , with characters who are both icons and real people at the same time . \namerica has always had its mythical heros , its paul bunyans and john waynes ; this film presents us with more general , but still universal , ideals : the honest , innocent children who have their own inner wisdom ; the athletes who seem to be amalgamations of courage , honor , and love for their respective sport ; the venerable elected official who leads with kindness and understanding , but has the grit to get things done when they need doin\' ( does the latter sound familiar ? ) . \namazing grace and chuck is a showcase for these characters , but it never leaves you with the feeling that it\'s artificial , that it stands behind glass , or that any sharp breeze--or , more importantly , sharp thought--will shatter the wax facade of the panorama . \nthis is a very sturdy scenario . \nthe principals are always given dialogue , and always give performances--always ( it just blows me away ) -- which made them seem real , yet enforces their particular mythic role . \nthe writer/producer , david field , seems to literally take all the \" yeah , but in real life , this would have happen \" thoughts you get in your head , sticks them in the movie and uses them to bend the plot around to his original heading , in a stronger way then before ! \nastounding ! \nhe uses obstacles to the plot to * enforce * it ! \ni am truly impressed ( indeed , envious ) with the skill in which he wrote the story and screenplay ; it\'s so very unusual , especially in a hollywood film . \ni don\'t want to give too much away , but the basic premise is that chuck ( joshua zuehlke ) , the little league pitcher , decides to give up baseball because of nuclear weapons . \nhis decision begins an unlikely series of events that involve another athlete , a boston basketball player ( alex english ) , \" amazing \" grace smith , and , well , i\'m leaving it at that because i wouldn\'t spoil this film for you for the world . \nlet me just say this , though : i am not recommending this film because i think it has a great message or because of any political positions it might imply . \ni don\'t give a rat\'s ass for the political point-of-view this film expresses , one way or another ; i\'m recommending you go see this film because , and only because , it\'s an excellent story , told with excellence . \nno , i don\'t believe what happens in this film could happen in real life ; while i tend to believe the arms control policy of this country is stilted , i believe in careful negotiations , mutual verification , etc . screw what i think . \nthe point is , this film is able to suspend my disbelief and tell a story that is one of the most finely crafted pieces of american dream i have ever seen on the movie screen . \nthis is the natural and more--all the mythic qualities without the pretentiousness or the forced feeling of the conclusion , and a much better script to boot . \nit carried me into the beliefs and ideals of my boyhood--and , more importantly , without any bumps or jolts that would snap me out of the trance with some hint of self-consciousness . \nspecial kudos to : both zuehlke ( a real-life little league pitcher who was picked for the part ) and english ( a forward for the denver nuggets ) for their seamless personification of their characters ; jamie lee curtis , who takes a surprisingly small role and makes it exceedingly memorable as amazing\'s manager and friend ; william l . peterson ( in a * big * change from his role in to live and die in l . a . ) as a father who shows principles without having to stand up and wave a flag doing it ; and gregory peck , as the guy we wish ronald reagan really was ( and who some numbskulls still probably think he is \n'
?,'eric rohmer\'s \" pauline at the beach , \" is one of those small , deliberately paced , but charming foreign films in which not much happens plot wise , but a lot happens to the characters emotionally . \nthe film takes place during a few weeks of august at the normandy coast , and centers on six different characters , primarily pauline ( amanda langlet ) , a wise beyond her years 15-year-old who has come to stay for the summer with her older cousin , marion ( arielle dombasle ) . \non the first day at the beach , marion runs into an old high school flame ( fedoore atkine ) , and although he wants to rekindle their relationship , she is more interested in an older , more seductive womanizer ( pascal greggory ) , who is also secretly having an affair with a candy vendor ( rosette ) . \nwhile pauline watches as an outsider at what is happening between all of the adults , she forms a relationship of her own with a young teenage boy ( simon de la brosse ) . \n \" pauline at the beach , \" is not a film in which big dramatic things occur , and there is not a clear-cut , tidy conclusion to the story . \ninstead , it is a picture that simply observes its characters in every day life , and the surprises come from little character details . the film is quite talky and slow moving , and so it is pretty safe to say it isn\'t for those who are only a fan of action movies , but is a treat for those viewers who often like to venture outside of the big-budget genre and see a good art film . \nthis is the first film by acclaimed director eric rohmer ( 1969\'s \" my night at mauds , \" and 1971\'s \" claire\'s knee \" ) that i have seen , but his direction is assured and intelligent , as is the screenplay , which he also wrote . \n \" pauline at the beach , \" is a film worth seeing . \n'

?,'[note : after claiming otherwise , my appetite was indeed whetted by kenneth branagh\'s hamlet to search out other attempts to translate shakespeare to film in hopes of finding a better mousetrap . \nas it happens , it didn\'t take long . ] \nis there a more romantic director than franco zeffirelli ? \nknown mainly to american audiences as the man behind 1968\'s romeo and juliet ( required viewing for many high schoolers , and as much as most ever learn of shakespeare ) , he is also a favorite at the metropolitan opera , where his achingly beautiful designs further the already lush emotion of many a puccini aria . \nlast year he gave us his beautifully realized version of jane eyre , one of the twin peaks ( with wuthering heights ) of romantic literature . \nit might seem peculiar , then , that zeffirelli ever had an interest in translating hamlet for the screen . \nat first blush , hamlet is far removed from romance . \nthe hero , though a prince , is depressed , conflicted and confused . \nthe ostensible love interest gets little screen time , and her scenes with her prince are usually as an object of mockery . \nthe plot is full of political intrigue and the players are as cursed as the house of atreus . \nit is zeffirelli\'s genius , however , that he is able to expose the romantic core of hamlet and give the sometimes dry tale an emotional embrace . \nin this italian master\'s hands , romance is everywhere -- in a son\'s worship of his father , in the bonds of deepest friendship , in the private thoughts of young lovers , even in the mystery of castles by the sea . \nafter all , the story hinges on a ghost , and what could be more romantic than that ? \nwhat seemed like a cheap way to sell tickets at the time turned out to be one of the most romantic gestures of all , namely , hiring then-reigning hollywood hunk mel gibson to play the lead . \nwho could believe that the man who made his mark playing mad max and a \" lethal weapon \" ( in the series of the same name ) would have the skill to succeed in the most famous role in the english language ? \nfranco zeffirelli , that\'s who . \nand it is apparent in every frame that his instinct was right on the money . \nwhat gibson brings to the role is a naturalness and ease which makes the whole story meaningful , not to mention comprehensible . \nhis line readings sound spontaneous rather than rehearsed . \nhis movements and gestures ( excepting his sometimes too active eyes ) are totally in keeping with the character . \nthis is a hamlet whose pain we feel , whose struggle we empathize with , and whose death we mourn as sincerely as horatio at film\'s end . \nglenn close , the other big name in the production , also does well by the script and satisfies as hamlet\'s mother , gertrude -- though i must confess i\'m still trying to understand the character as written . \n ( zeffirelli\'s incestuous interpretation of hamlet\'s relationship with his mother doesn\'t help . ) \nalan bates makes a believably evil claudius without resorting to the mannerisms of a hollywood heavy . \nby and large the rest of the cast performs admirably and comfortably . \nof special note are the cinematography by david watkin and the score by ennio morricone . \nboth support the realistic mood marvelously ( as do the sets and costumes ) , without any overstated effects that declare \" this is important ; this is shakespeare ! \" \ni particularly appreciate that the words are often spoken without any music at all : the melody of a wonderfully wrought phrase is given its due . \nperhaps it is difficult to call edited shakespeare \" definitive . \" \nand there are certainly quite a few other filmed versions of hamlet that i have not seen . \nbut if you\'ve ever felt the urge to overcome your fear of the bard , this hamlet is an excellent place to start . \n'

?,'every now and then , reviewers are faced with the films that are hard to be properly reviewed . \nmost of the time it happens with films that leave so overwhelming impact , either good or bad , that in the end reviewers must work hard to express his thoughts or feelings . \nbut , sometimes it can happen for rather trivial reasons . \ni love trouble happened to be one of such occasions for the author of this review . \nthe impression left by the film wasn\'t overwhelming - on the contrary , there were hardly any impression at all , since i had real trouble keeping myself awake while watching it . \nwhich surprise me to this day , because the movie theatre was full , i was close to sound speakers , the show wasn\'t late and i didn\'t lack sleep before the show . \nsuch things happen very rarely to me , and , after many years , the closest thing to solution to this mystery is probably the quality of the film itself . \nthe plot revolves around two rival chicago reporters - old peter brackett ( nick nolte ) and young , aspiring sabrina peterson ( julia roberts ) . \ntwo of them are assigned to cover the train collision . \nas soon as they meet , they start scooping each other , but during the process they both discover sinister plot involving cancerogenic milk , and also the romantic feelings they have for each other . \nthe plot in this film is rather secondary to its real raison d\' ? tre - romantic pairing reminiscent of classical screwball comedies starring spencer tracy and katharine hepburn . \nmovie author , director and screenwriter charles shyer , who had some experiences with turning the screwball spirit into modern setting with father of the bride , tries again , this time pairing old nick nolte with young julia roberts . \nhowever , although there is some chemistry between the two , soon it stops to arouse any interest . \nit probably happens due to poorly executed genre mix , that collides light-hearted romantic comedy with rather uninteresting plot suitable to pure action thrillers . \nshyer as director fails to make the proper transition between the two , and fails in both areas , making the story cliched and predictable . \nthe end result is rather forgettable effort , which convinced me not to watch movie again . \ni\'ll give it the benefit of the doubt , though . \n'
?,'the only two really good things that i can say about tarzan and the lost city are as follows : jane march was very cute as jane , and the movie was thankfully under 90 minutes in length . \nif you haven\'t already figured it out , i didn\'t like this movie very much . \nthe plot was boring and contrived to the extreme . \ntarzan ( casper van dien ) has now left the jungle and living in civilized society . \nhe is just days away from his impending marriage to jane , played by the aptly named jane march . \nback in his former home of africa , a group of looters has found the key to locating a lost city . \n ( mind you i never really figured out why they actually wanted to find this city . ) \nanyway , tarzan\'s old jungle friend appears to him in a vision . \ntarzan realizes that he must return to africa to help stop the bad guys from finding the lost city . \nhe leaves jane ( his first mistake , in my opinion ) and travels to africa . \nof course , jane is hot on her ape man\'s heals . \nthe two of them are reunited in africa where they do battle with the bad guys . \nsound like a dumb explanation of the plot ? \nit\'s actually an improvement over the real thing . \nthe acting is just plain awful . \ni\'m not quite sure what casper van dien was doing in this film , but it wasn\'t acting . \njane march wasn\'t a heck of a lot better , but at least she is easy on the eyes . \ncompounding the bad acting was the fact that in many places the dialogue had obviously been re-recorded , and i\'ve seen better dubbing in some old bruce lee movies . \nadded to the sound problems was the cinematography . \nthis film was filled with beautiful african scenery . \nbut the panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed to me . \nquite frankly , i think you could probably do a better job capturing the beauty of africa with a camcorder than this bunch did with professional film equipment . \nthen we have the special effects . \n \" special effects in a tarzan movie ? \" \nyou are no doubt asking yourself ? \nyes friends , the writers injected some very out of place supernatural elements into the story . \nprobably for the sake of using cgi , since it did nothing but hurt the story . \nin most parts , they weren\'t bad , just nothing special . \nbut , they were more than a little on the hokey side . \nexcept of course , when we got to the ridiculous climax of this movie . \nthe grand finale\'s special effects went right into the toilet at that point . \nit almost looked like they had run out of money . \nthese effects were of noticeably lower quality than those in the rest of the film and looked like something in an amateur video production . \ni took one lesson away from watching tarzan and the lost city -- ape men and bones that morph into skeletal warriors don\'t mix . \nstay far away from this version of tarzan . \n'
?,'silly performances and some huge gaps in logic mar an otherwise interesting tale of an eclectic group of people stranded at \" the last stop cafe and motel \" due to heavy snowfall . \none of the stranded is a colorado state highway patrolman ( adam beach ) who discovers a murder scene and a bag full of cash from a recent bank robbery . \nsomeone amongst the group of strangers is a bank robber and a murderer , but is it the same person or are there multiple criminals ? \nadam beach unfortunately was the wrong choice for the lead in this film . \nhe doesn\'t play the role with enough seriousness to be believable or enough goofiness for it to be funny . \nhis performance is stuck somewhere in the middle , and this film really needed it to be on one side or the other . \nrose mcgowan is cold and unpleasant to the eye as always , and jurgen prochnow . . . \nwhat on earth is he doing in this ? \nbest performance comes from william s . taylor as a cheesy ( yet still somehow cool and confident ) wayne newton drifter type . \nthe last stop is available on dvd from sterling home entertainment . \nas usual with sterling , they\'ve filled out this dvd with extra features . \nthe disc contains the film in its original aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , a choice of 2 . 0 dolby surround sound or 5 . 1 dolby digital surround sound , a full length audio commentary track with director mark malone , interviews with the cast and crew , the original trailer , and the usual cast and crew biographies . \nthe film itself might not be the greatest , but sterling\'s effort of adding decent extra features while keeping the price affordable ( suggested retail of $19 . 95 ) makes this dvd worth the money . \n[r] \n'
?,'i rented \" brokedown palace \" last night blind , having heard nothing about it beforehand , and i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws . \nfor anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety . \nthat is no easy task . \nsuperficially , it bears an unfortunate ( and not necessarily unintended ) resemblance to several other movies , notably \" return to paradise \" and \" midnight express . \" \nas a result nearly every review of \" brokedown palace \" i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons . \nthe consequence was nearly universal condemnation , which is a shame as this is a fine film . \nfor those who have yet to view the movie , let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system ( as was \" midnight express \" ) nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of \" return to paradise . \" \nin my view , if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad\'s acclaimed novel , \" lord jim . \" \nproblematically , the basic storyline seems more than familiar : two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set-up involving a suave con-man , a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world \" justice \" system . \nthe girls are alice ( claire danes ) and darlene ( kate beckinsale ) . \nthey\'re life-long buddies who planned a high-school graduation trip to hawaii , and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents . \nonce there , they find a $6 hotel and go sight-seeing , which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside . \nthey get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room , a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them , but they are saved from hotel security by a charming , friendly australian , nick ( daniel lapaine ) , who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girl\'s scam . \nhe then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves , first toward alice , then toward darlene . \nby now alarm bells are going off among viewers . \nthe ever-present nick is too slick and his stories don\'t add up ( to us ) --the girls , of course , are too naive to notice . \nlong before it happens , we\'re anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast-talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting-ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag ( literally ) containing heroin . \njust as predictably , the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison-bound for a long stretch . \nleft unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice . \nfor those in need of a ready answer , might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl\'s fleabag hotel . \nas one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed , the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer/fixer \" yankee hank \" ( bill pullam ) and his thai-born partner-wife . \na recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the film\'s tag lines , \" who do you trust ? , \" and hank is no exception although seasoned movie- goers and those familiar with pullman\'s oeuvre will find few surprises . \nmuch of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short-hand fashion . \nlou diamond phillips , for instance , plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who , while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank , withholds vital information at crucial moments . \nis he part of a wider conspiracy ? \nwith an inherently powerful , if somewhat tired premise , the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama , a prison story , and a potential character study of american teens , their relationship , and what constitutes friendship between them . \nthe result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful , with the girls\' interaction , hank\'s investigation , and the various trials and hearings , offering hope for their release , delivering tension--as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape . \nif \" brokedown palace \" has a major flaw , it is its creators\' tendency , like time-constrained tourists , to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half-way down and return to the story\'s main avenue . \nand , if that were all there was to \" brokedown palace , \" it wouldn\'t be a very good movie . \nbut i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and , in this , they succeeded . \nfor the main theme of the movie , like the proffered name of its location , is freedom--in all its permutations . \nultimately , the other sub-themes may be considered window dressing . \nyoung and pretty , alice ( danes ) is an old soul ; a wild , streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure . \npresented as a perfect blend of yin and yang , dark and light , is her cautious best friend , darlene ( beckinsale ) . \nclear-eyed and straightforward , alice is more complex than her friend . \nshe comes from a poorer background , has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone ( including her own father ) . \nwhereas darlene\'s life is \" on-track , \" aimed at college , marriage , kids , a career , a suburban home , middle age and \" fulfillment , \" alice\'s is uncertain , unfocused , and yearning . \none poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors--friends and relatives from home , whose lives continue while hers is in limbo . \ntellingly , alice is present but not included . \njust as revealing of their different personalities , when alice and dar first come to thailand , the openness and delight on alice\'s face doesn\'t read as simple naivet ? ; the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat , reaching toward the sun , she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom , while \" dar \" remains seated in the shade . \n \" brokedown palace \" begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank . \nhowever unintentional , it\'s all alice\'s fault . \nshe\'s responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents , to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand , to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick . \n ( in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a film\'s beginning , darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison . ) \ndar , of course , is the willing dupe which , in her view , confers innocence . \nnever mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate . \ndar is innocent . \nit doesn\'t matter . \nalice is the subject of this movie . \nshe and her journey toward personal freedom . \nalong the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half-baked sensibilities and materialistic goals . \nin the end , that culture , like its representatives , \" yankee \" hank and dar\'s father ( a \" man who knows how to grease the wheels \" ) , proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girl\'s tragedy . \nthailand\'s culture , contrary to most opinion , comes off much better by comparison . \nit amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes . \ni believe the filmmaker\'s view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior . \nthe thai ( with the sole exceptions of a corrupt official and a spiteful prison spy ) were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles . \nthe girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the native-born . \ntheir prison ( in stark contrast to the probable reality ) was no hellhole , being relatively clean and sunlit . \nthe prison authorities demanded good hygiene , provided medical care when needed , and \" hard manual labor \" consisted of picking grass ! \nthe thai guards were authoritarian ( what else ? ) but certainly not routinely sadistic . \nas for the thai justice system , the reasoning of the thai judges , during both an appeal hearing and in the film\'s penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality . \n\'freedom\' has many faces and \" brokedown palace \" explores many of them . \nin the extreme , we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit . \nsome settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter . \nbut freedom seldom comes without a price . \nwhich is why the movie\'s other tag lines are : \" what is your dream ? \" \nand \" how far would you go ? \" \ni believe i could make a good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom , incarcerated or not , by film\'s end is alice . \nshe finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility . \ni think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact . \nkate beckinsale\'s character might more properly be likened to the \" released \" temple bird referred to twice during the film , \" trained to fly back to its cage . \" \nas the thai magistrate observed in the film\'s climactic scene , the issue was always one of \" character ; \" and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that \" freedom \" is achieved within oneself . \nif one thinks back over the movie , which character was transformed by their experiences ? \nincreasingly , the cinema landscape seems to have become littered with endless permutations of \'kung fu woman\'--female characters virtually indistinguishable from male action figures . \nhere , at last , is the story of a modern heroine . \nin reading the many user\'s comments , i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon : whether or not a person liked the movie , almost everyone praised the actors . \nthink about that . \nwhen was the last time you came away from a motion picture possibly hating it , but raving about all the performances in it ? \ndo yourself a favor : rent \" brokedown palace \" and watch it with a open mind . \nthere\'s more there than meets the eye . \n'
?,'everyone\'s heard about this movie , and more specifically , * the * scene . \neveryone\'s heard the famous barnyard animal quote squealed ( no pun intended ) over and over . \nand everyone\'s got to admit that they will never travel down a river again without thinking of deliverance . \ngood ! \nthat\'s what you\'re supposed to do ! \noh , if you are one of the ones who hasn\'t seen this yet , or you ( somehow ) haven\'t heard about what happens , here\'s your spoiler warning . \ndeliverance was a real shocker for it\'s time ( 1972 ) . \nmajor advances were being made in films , and deliverance made its own advances when it introduced a new horror into the film industry . \nwhen it was first released , it literally shocked the audiences . \nit was something that , for the most part , had really never been seen on the big screen before ( among wide-release films with an r rating ) . \nbut by today\'s film standards and in today\'s world , such scenes as the one in deliverance can be reproduced in a way that isn\'t as shocking , although they can be even more graphic ( e . g . \npulp fiction ) . \npulp fiction did it in a way , and expanded on it in a way , that it could even be interpreted as funny . \nbut in 1972 , deliverance was no laughing matter . \nthe story centers around a group of four atlanta men who decide to take a rafting trip down a backwoods river in georgia while the river is still there and in its glory . \nthe initial leader of the group is lewis ( burt reynolds in his prime ) , a real outdoorsman and more of a daniel boone-type then any of the others . \njoining him are ed ( jon voight ) , bobby ( ned beatty ) , and drew ( ronny cox ) . \nthe group\'s first objective is to find someone ( s ) to drive their cars down the river to the point where they will end their trip . \nthey make arrangements with a few mountain men , who accept $40 . 00 for the task . \ndrew also has the famous \" dueling banjos \" competition with a local who is , let us say , genetically challenged . \nthe men then set off down the river , with lewis , also the master at canoeing , leading the way . \neverything seems to be going fine , until the two canoes split up , leaving the unexperienced ed and bobby alone . \nthey encounter two hillbillies , armed with a shotgun , who captured them . \ned is tied to a tree while bobby is sodomized by one of the men . \ned nearly receives the same cruelty , but lewis arrives just in time to fire an arrow through the rapist\'s back . \nthe other hillbilly gets away , and the men have to decide what to do with the dead body . \ndisposing of dead bodies is done rather frequent throughout this film . \nwhile attempting to make a quick \" paddle for it \" , both canoes tip over . \ndrew , who was without a life jacket , was possibly shot and cannot be found . \nlewis suffered a rather nasty compound fracture during the incident and is in serious condition . \nthis leaves ed and bobby . \ned decides to go out and look for the remaining hillbilly , alone , with the bow and arrow . \nthe question arises if he will be able to handle himself , as he horribly botched a first shot attempt at a deer , to which his comment \" i wonder how anyone could kill a living thing \" will have more meaning in the future . \ndeliverance is definitely a wild ride ( oops , i\'m doing it again ) . \nit is extremely tense at some points and very dramatic . \nit\'s definitely one of those \" must see \" movies and should be considered one of the classics of its decade . \n'
?,'synopsis : captain picard and the crew of the starship enterprise disobey federation orders and defend a peaceful community of 600 , the ba\'ku , from the evil admiral dougherty and ru\'afro . \nthe enterprise crew , in the meantime , experience the rejuvenating qualities of the ba\'ku homeworld : lt . worf grows a pimple , data sings opera pieces , picard scores with a ba\'ku chick , riker shaves while sharing a bubblebath with troi , and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts . \ncomments : \" star trek : the next generation \" was a hugely successful sequel tv series to \" star trek , \" a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s . \neven though it still enjoyed high ratings , \" star trek : the next generation \" ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original \" star trek \" \'s cast in paramount\'s film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise . \nstar trek : insurrection is the ninth \" star trek \" movie and the third to focus on the \" star trek : the next generation \" crew . \nstar trek : insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans , such as myself , would rate somewhere between \" okay \" and \" good . \" \nafter star trek v : the final frontier , a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant \" star trek : voyager \" tv series , \" star trek \" fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise . \ni don\'t wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies . \nmost people reading this probably haven\'t followed \" star trek \" anyway , so a comparison would seem tedious at best . \nlet me , thus , make my comparisons briefly so that it\'s out of my system : star trek : insurrection is not as good as the previous installment , star trek : first contact ; star trek : insurrection\'s comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv : the voyage home ; star trek ii : the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie . \nokay . let\'s move to the movie itself . \nstar trek : insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise , humanity\'s exploration and colonization of space , with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners . \nthis combination works well more often than it fails , but when it does fail , the humor really seems cheesy . \nmuch of this film appeals to trek fans\' nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise\'s crew . \naudiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times . \nstar trek : insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba\'ku homeworld . \nforget the actors and special effects , the beautiful setting of this movie , with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys , steals the show . \nthis tranquility , however , is broken by data , an android , who reveals to the ba\'ku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies , the son\'a . \nit seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth , sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young , healthy state . \nthe enterprise crew , led by captain picard , investigates data\'s actions and uncovers a conspiracy between the son\'a and an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba\'ku and plunder the planet\'s youth-restoring properties . \nsound pretty heavy ? \nit is , though this plot , anything but unique and groundbreaking , is undermined by the film\'s constant barrage of humor . \nwhen going after data , for instance , picard sings an opera piece with him ( this is supposed to be cute and humorous ) . \nin a much more funny sequence , work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba\'ku homeworld , a pimple which his crewmates , try as they might , cannot avoid looking at . \nthe acting in star trek : insurrection is , for the most part , pretty good . \nsince they\'ve been playing these characters for years , those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough . \nthe terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean-luc picard and delivers a moral speech , picard\'s trademark , with his usual aplomb . \nbrent spiner , another fine actor , plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film ( though the old android-wishing-to-be-human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series ) . \nthe supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good . \ndespite many other critics\' negative opinions , f . murray abraham ( the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus ) plays the major villain ru\'afro well enough . \nru\'afro reminds me , somewhat , of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune . \nlike the baron , ru\'afro continuously has his skin looked after : it is stretched and stapled by servants . \nin one particularly memorable scene , ru\'afro becomes very agitated , and his facial skin splits open and bleeds . \nru\'afro is no khan from star trek ii--the best trek villain ever--but he is much better than the forgettable dr . soran from star trek : generations . \n ( okay , i promise , no more comparisons . ) \ndonna murphy must also be noted as a ba\'ku woman , anij , who picard falls in love with . \nmurphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body ; she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance . \nthis is the type of woman whom picard , for those who know the character well , would be enchanted with . \nin fact , the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here . \na particular plot point involving anij\'s ability to slow time down , an ability which she shares with picard , becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie . \nfor as good as the actors and setting were , star trek : insurrection\'s special effects were surprisingly disappointing . \nthey proved adequate , sometimes barely , for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film , but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars : the phantom menace ( a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection ) . \nthe space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships , in particular , seemed trite and unsuspenseful , and the final confrontation between picard and ru\'afro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite . \nthe new enterprise itself , only seen in this film and its predecessor , remains largely unexplored , though its exterior doesn\'t look quite right for a reason i cannot explain . \ndespite star trek : insurrection\'s frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects , i enjoyed the film . \nit maintains roddenberry\'s largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors , particularly star trek : first contact ( though , don\'t get me wrong , the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully ) . \ni\'d recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon , especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general . \nrated pg , i can\'t see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience , young or old . \n'
?,'to watch `battlefield earth\' is to wallow in misery . \nit is one of the most ludicrously conceived efforts in recent history . \nit has a clumsily told story , insipid dialogue , shallow characterizations , ugly scene transitions , no evidence of dramatic arc , headache-inducing sound effects , and a resolution that is completely implausible . \nworse , there\'s the promise of a sequel . \nwhy ? ! \nsave your money . \nsome films go quickly to video . \nthis one , however , should go straight to the sci-fi channel\'s `mystery science theatre . \' \nin the year 3000 , man has become an endangered species . \nmost of humanity ( called ? man-animals\' ) was destroyed generations ago in a battle against a race of plundering aliens ( called psychlos ) . \nsurvivors have either taken up shelter in caves or were enslaved to mine earth\'s resources for the rest of their lives . \nthe aliens are a menacing looking humanoid species that stand nine-feet tall , who resemble inbred klingons . \ndimwitted as they are tall , their culture is predicated on power , extortion , and getting ? leverage . \' \ntravolta , the leverage-using star , plays terl , the conniving security chief that oversees the mining facility on earth . \nmuch of the movie is spent showing us examples of terl\'s petty machinations . \nhe routinely employs deception and then punctuates his statements with maniacal laughter . \nbut one thing is certain ; he hates being stationed on earth . \nwhen the home planet informs him that he will be spending the rest of his life on this planet , he begins to devise his latest plan . \nhe will select a group of slaves to secretly mine out a gold ore site . \nit\'s not clear how this benefits terl , except that it makes him richer in a place where he has no use for it . \nthe scrappy jonnie goodboy tyler ( barry peppers ) is selected as the slave group\'s leader . \na psychlo knowledge machine gives him the mining know-how . \nbut the machine also teaches him other things such as the psychlo language , the principles of our founding fathers , euclidean geometry , and the location of fort knox . \nthis enlightenment just doesn\'t prepare him for the mining assignment . \nit also prepares him to organize and stage a massive revolt against their captors . \n`we\'re going to blow up their home world , \' he says . \n`but first , we need a few more supplies . \' \nin days , he and his comrades evolve from cave dwelling , loincloth wearing , rat eating slaves to fighter pilots and nuclear weapons experts . \nby now , the audience is laughing as maniacally as terl . \nthe media have been working overtime to let the public know that john travolta\'s labor of love is a piece of sci-fi drivel . \nnumerous journals have called it an ill-conceived idea stemming from blind hubris , arrogance , and poor planning . \nand after watching this movie , you\'ll wholeheartedly agree . \nthis is a terrible film that is illogically constructed , tediously acted , and frequently begs the question : why was this ever made ? \nat a price tag of $90 million , this film will be remembered as a gigantic folly , assuredly becoming `the avengers\' of this summer . \nboth films were unforgivable and this promises to suffer the same speedy fate and subsequent indignity . \nin addition to the universally pejorative reviews , there\'s another bizarre element to the `battlefield\' saga . \nthis film would never have been made if not for the star power of travolta , who for over a decade , had been trying to persuade studios to bring the story to the big screen . \nthe controversy is that travolta is a scientologist , and `battlefield\' is based on a 1982 novel by l . ron hubbard , the religion\'s late founder . \nthis led some to believe that `battlefield earth\' would amount to scientologist dogma , laden with subliminal messages . \nbut the story is so poorly told that any message , subliminal or otherwise , is totally undetectable . \nif the audience got anything out of this film , it was this : we are not too unlike the psychlo leader . \nlike terl , the audience felt imprisoned , dreaded their situation , and looked for any opportunity to leave . \ncould that be the scientology message ? \n'
?,'in the wake of the smashing success of \" rumble in the bronx , \" it\'s looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release . \nrumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii . \nthe version i have is a copy from the laserdisc ; it\'s widescreen and bilingually-subtitled , as are most hong kong films these days . \navailability over here in the united states is very limited ; these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng . \nthe subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read ; the letters are white and a bit small . \nalthough the american release will almost certainly be dubbed , this review is of the subtitled version , so please keep that in mind if you\'re reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it . \nto be fair , i must admit that i\'ve never been very fond of \" period-piece \" martial arts movies--the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past . \nperhaps it\'s because most of those i\'ve seen were filmed on inferior stock , with either butchered dubbing or all-but-illegible subtitling , or perhaps it\'s because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and , in many cases , all but nonexistant . \nin fact , many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end . \nor , for that matter , it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings ( armour of god , rumble in the bronx , etc . ) tend to have more spectacular stunts , often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions , whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts . \nhaving said that , i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above , is one of the better martial arts films i\'ve seen , and i quite enjoyed it . \nsurprised ? \nwell , so was i . \ndrunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei-hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu . \nwhere he learned this style is uncertain , as his father , wong kei-ying ( ti lung ) is steadfast in his opposition to fei-hong\'s practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu . \napparently , fei-hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore , rather like paul bunyan is for americans , but i\'ve heard very little about this , and could quite well be wrong , so i\'ll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better . \none of my friends points out that the character of wong fei-hong is also featured in the \" once upon a time in china \" movies , but i have not yet seen those . \nthe plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy , as are the plots to many such films , but if you\'re watching a jackie chan film , odds are you aren\'t expecting something on the order of \" war and peace \" . \nthe story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence , china\'s cultural heritage ) while overworking , underpaying , and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill . \nhowever , this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the film--fei-hong\'s perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend , supplicate his father , keep his ( pregnant ) mother ( played by anita mui ) from fighting , and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs . \nthe macguffin that drives the plot ( s ) is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners . \nin the beginning , fei-hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically-wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer . \nin the process , he clashes with another thief , who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng . \nafter fei-hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners\' lackies , thanks to some timely intervention by a general\'s son ( a cameo appearance by andy lau , who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii ! ) , comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei-hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng . \nand so it goes . \nand the plot thickens later on , such as when fei-hong\'s girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival , or when fei-hong and the thief , now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners , are attacked en masse ( another grand kung-fu movie tradition ) , but i think i\'ve already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves . \nlet\'s move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies . . . the \naction . \nthere\'s plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie . . . of \ncourse , in a kung fu film , that\'s to be expected . \nhowever , this isn\'t just another kung fu movie ; this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography , and jackie chan is a genius . \nthe primary martial arts \" style \" featured in the film is drunken boxing , a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk . \nfurther , for the purposes of this film at least , drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated . . . but \nthere\'s a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor . \nunder normal circumstances , the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid , but jackie pulls it off with flair . \nthe kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper , so i\'ll just say that the fights--especially the big climactic fight at the end--in themselves make the movie worth watching . \nanother thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work . \neven without motor vehicles ( well , not counting a train ) , there are some remarkable stunts in this film . \namong other things , jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals ( not once , but at _least_ twice , if you count the outtake shown during the credits ) . \n ( quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database . ) \nunlike in american films , these stunts are _not_ faked . \ndrunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene , including jackie , ti lung ( \" a better tomorrow \" 1 & 2 ) , and anita mui ( the \" heroic trio \" series , \" rumble in the bronx \" ) . \nthe performances are first-rate , especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film . \nthe scene where fei-hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei-hong\'s father\'s back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious , as is the scene where fei-hong\'s mother , having just revealed that she is pregnant , is threatening to hurt herself ( in order to draw her husband\'s anger away from fei-hong ) . \njackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years , and he\'s in fine form all through drunken master ii . \nas far as cinematography is concerned , it certainly works for this film . \nit\'s nothing spectacular , but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s . \nthe picture is crisp and clear . \none thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that , at least in the copy i have , the screen was wider than any film i\'ve ever seen on videotape before--almost a whole 1/3 of the screen was blocked out above and below . \n ( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can . ) \nit will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan-and-scanned for american video release . \ndrunken master ii shows the full potential of \" period piece \" kung fu movies , and it\'s good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies . \nthe plot does meander a bit , but that\'s to be expected in this type of film . \nif you like this kind of movie , you\'ll love this movie , and if not , well , give it a chance anyway . \nif nothing else , the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental . \n'
?,'director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days ( terry gilliam comes to mind as another one ) . \nfilm is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story , but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something . \nbut most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story . \nso whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential , the film almost automatically deserves a good review . \nand when they add a fascinating story to it , you have nearly perfect entertainment . \nfincher\'s the game is no exception to this . \nthe game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time . \nfincher hasn\'t made a film since \" seven , \" his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever . \nso it is about time he made another film . \nand what a ride it is . \nthe game isn\'t quite as powerful as \" seven , \" but in some ways it is better . \noverall , the game could have used a little more clarity , or a little more uncertainty . \nit walks a line of insanity and reality , but it never goes either way until the very end . \nthe outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events , and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight . \nunfortunately , unlike \" the usual suspects , \" we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening , whether it be true or false . \nhowever , this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent . \nthe game is told completely from its main character\'s point of view . \nnicholas van orton ( michael douglas ) is a high-strung and isolated businessman . \nhe lives alone in his giant mansion , divorced from his wife elizabeth , and is celebrating his 48th birthday ; the same age at which his father committed suicide at , in the same mansion . \nfor his 48th birthday , conrad ( sean penn ) , the rebel of the family , gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs : consumer recreation services . \n \" it will make your life fun again , \" his brother promises . \nas skeptical as nicholas is , he is somewhat intrigued , and annoyed by the lack of information--something this businessman hates . \nseeing a billboard in an office , he decides to visit the mysterious company . \njim feingold ( james rebhorn ) greets nicholas and guides him through the sign-up process , which consists of psych-tests , physicals , emotional responses , and other mind games . \n \" each game is suited to each person\'s emotional and psychological needs , \" explains feingold . \none day , nicholas gets a call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests . \neven more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up , he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company . \nwhat he doesn\'t realize is that the game has already begun . \nthe phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas\' way . \nhow he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive . \nthe detail involved in fincher\'s shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them . \nwith \" seven , \" fincher had almost every single shot mean something . \nhe also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to . \ncompared to \" seven , \" though , the game is light and comical . \nbecause of this film\'s sense of humor and self-awareness , nothing can be taken quite seriously . \nso don\'t try to make much sense of what goes on in the game , because it doesn\'t want you to . \nwhat does make sense is the final revelation--when everything becomes apparent and clear . \nif taken as it is , the game\'s ending makes complete sense . \nbut if you try and critique every minute detail , then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility . \nperhaps that is the reason i docked the film . \nwhile trying to remain realistic and plausible , the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen . \nwe don\'t really care if douglas\' character lives or not because it isn\'t believable . \nthe ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously , but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is , you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller . \nmichael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas . \ndouglas has played lonely businessmen before , but here he adds another level to his performance . \nhis character , who is normally level-headed and relies on facts , is forced to trust nobody . \ncan he believe the waitress he bumped into ? \nwhat about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place ? \ndouglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well , and gives one of his best performances ( even better than his \" falling down \" persona ) . \nthe supporting cast is essential in this film , and casting was critical . \nsean penn is always good , and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas\' brother . \ndeborah kara unger ( from \" crash \" ) is the waitress he bumps into , and her performance is extremely good . \nin fact , she almost steals the film from douglas . \njames rebhorn portrays his character very well , and adds some confusion and desparation to douglas\' predicament . \nanother good performance comes from armin mueller-stahl ( from \" shine \" ) as the book editor . \nbut considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game , he not only commands this cast , but makes this distant and lonely character come to colorful life . \nthe game is rated r for language , violence , some gore , and some nudity and drugs . \nwhat is essential for this film to work is the writing . \njohn brancato and michael ferris have woven a confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue , and some very funny moments . \nthis screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects\' did . \nhowever , the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot . \nand if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen , you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year\'s best films . \n'
?,'sometimes , when i decide to write a short story or a poem , i think of a title first , and then think of a subject to go with it . \nit seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence . \ni wouldn\'t be surprised if a couple of guys got together and created the opening credits , and then someone saw it and made up a story to go along with it . \nthe title sequence is so good , so ominous and original , that it had me engrossed before the picture even began . \nof course , my attention dwindled shortly into the film . \ndisturbing behavior , like so many thrillers , starts off interesting and ends up laughably ridiculous . \nit\'s a teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex . \nit\'s a suspense film with no suspense . \nit\'s an evil small town story with no story to speak of . \nit\'s a disaster , a listless and uninspired disaster , that just barely misses one-stardom because of a few good sequences , a mercifully short running time , and one terrific set of opening credits . \nour main man is a fellow named steve clark , blandly played by jimmy marsden . \nhe moves to a small town with his family after , tragically , his brother shoots himself . \nsteve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother ; we learn this through strange home-video like nightmares that he has occasionally . \nthe big trial for steve is , of course , to fit in at school and make new friends . \nmarsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail , so he seems a poor casting choice for a social reject . \nas a social reject , he falls in with some pretentious dope-smoking philosophers , gavin ( nick stahl ) and rachel ( katie holmes ) . \ngavin informs steve that the local group of jocks , known as the blue ribboners , are actually a bunch of zombies , assimilating new members into their group , while sporadically killing innocent people . \nso , it\'s up to our group of mismatched protagonists to 1 ) solve the mystery , and 2 ) do something about it . \nby the end of it all , something has happened and things have been explained , but the film still doesn\'t make any sense . \ndisturbing behavior was written by scott rosenberg . \ni\'ve seen his name around recently ( he was one of the toucher-uppers on the armageddon script ) , and i imagine that , for the most part , he knows what he\'s doing when it comes to screenwriting . \nhe did , however , have a complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this film , and then decided to actually take the time to write it out . \nevil small town films are pretty common ( the last one , phantoms , is also a dismal failure ) , but it takes a lot of skill to make the formula work . \nrosenberg\'s script is a complete mess , lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization . \nand it makes no sense , nor is their any purpose when things are finally \" explained . \" \nthere is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks , but the film never explains exactly what * is * happening . \nthey get strapped to chairs , a microchip is inserted into their eyes , and -- poof -- they become sex-crazed , superviolent , machine-like creatures . \nthe doctor responsible for all this , dr . caldicott ( bruce greenwood ) , must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior is a step up from the way high school jocks actually behave ( or , perhaps , this is the only realistic element in the film ) . \nmuch of the writing is simply bad , and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high school kids act . \nin one terrible scene , gavin explains to steve all of the high school cliques , while pointing them out in the cafeteria . \nup front , i should say that , in four years of high school , i did not eat in the cafeteria even once . \nthat aside , the various social groups he points out are general , uninteresting , and poorly-shown . \nfor instance , he points to the \" nerds , \" who are all wearing glasses and playing with their laptops . \nit\'s such an obvious cliche that i can\'t believe rosenberg even bothered . \nmost of the dialogue is forced ( no one says , \" bite me ! \" \nanymore ) , and none of the scenes have any degree of wit . \nthis picture is not inspired , and most scenes flop from one to the other , with no sense of momentum or energy . \nthe blame for this can be placed on director david nutter , who apparently likes his films dry . \nhorror films should at least exploit violence , but this one is shockingly timid . \nthere are a few good scenes , though , such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum ( this is , however , the most forced scene in the film , for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn ) . \ni also liked the school janitor character , played by william sadler . \nhe has a few lines that are surprisingly thought-provoking . \nthe acting is largely a waste of talent . \nmarsden is , as i said , bland ( thought not particularly bad ) . \nbruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted . \nstahl and holmes both show they have talent , but the direction isn\'t good enough to hone in on their skills ( stahl\'s performance seems more like a parody of high school potheads ) . \nnone of these characters expand beyond their one dimension , and , frankly , watching cardboard cut-outs of human beings run down hallways while screaming just isn\'t all that cool . \ndisturbing behavior is a wreck of a film , and it started out a wreck before shooting even began . \ni\'m surprised there were producers who read this script and thought that it would make a good film , or that it would make a lot of money at the box office . \nit\'s not boring , or even blatantly awful , but it\'s an uninspired lump of a film . \nit sure starts off nicely , but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable . \nso , if you go to see this film , take my advice : appreciate the credit sequence , and pray it never ends . \n'
?,'set in the late 80\'s at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis ( who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie , less than zero ) , american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie \" genre \" that ellis helped to create . \nchristian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman , a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc ? e and his colleagues . \nit seems that bateman is a serial killer and , unfortunately for his contemporaries , his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip . \nas he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co-workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies , his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel . \ni was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school . \ni read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it . \nas usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out , but i soon forgot about the novel and didn\'t end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore . \ni picked it up and read it , but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers . \nthe movie has a similar effect , but at least it\'s less cryptic than ellis\' novel . \nfor once , a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on . \nboth the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations ( down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses ) but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout . \nthe movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in bateman\'s impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does . \nas a result , the film is immensely more entertaining . \nlions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films ( having picked up kevin smith\'s catholic-rattling dogma ) and here with american psycho there is no difference . \nscreenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it . \nsome cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc-17 , mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women , and initial reports said the film was unwatchable . \nthankfully , it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park : bigger , longer & uncut . \nside note #1 : co-writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an ill-fated acquaintance of bateman\'s who , after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute , proclaims that she\'s not a lesbian nor has any interest in it . \nthe ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner ( the writer/director of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy ) is a lesbian . \nit\'s a subtle in-joke and it\'s one i found to be pretty humorous . \ndespite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young up-and-comers ( including reese witherspoon ) , most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos . \nthe real draw here is christian bale and his over-the-top performance as patrick bateman . \nwhenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters . \ni always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman , but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being . \nto say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that he\'s as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger . \none sequence in particular , involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news\' song \" hip to be square \" right before burying an axe in a co-worker\'s head , features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film . \nside note #2 : despite the fact that huey lewis\' \" hip to be square \" and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film , don\'t expect to see them on the soundtrack release . \nhuey lewis expressly requested that his song , featured in a rather large set piece in the film ( much akin to the use of \" stuck in the middle with you \" in reservoir dogs ) , not be included on any soundtrack release . \ni\'m assuming that collins requested the same . \non a similar note , whitney houston\'s cover of \" the greatest love of all \" is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isn\'t the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source . \napparently , houston wasn\'t as open about the use of her song as the others were . \na bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the film\'s release : that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film . \ndon\'t look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more . \nseveral web sites have been dedicated to the subject but i\'m still undecided . \nthere is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops , old ladies , and cleaning staff with equal gusto . \nthe scene seemed very dream-like and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying ( as an example , bateman blows up a police car very cinematically after firing several shots from a handgun in the general direction of the car ) . \ni kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there , but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence , though comic , throws the film off-balance ( which i suppose was the intention ) . \nother than the few flaws i have mentioned , american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film ( although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in bateman\'s reality ) . \ni think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such . \nit may not change anyone\'s life , but it will certainly have an effect . \ni know i will certainly hear \" hip to be square \" in a different context the next time i hear it . \n[r] \n'
?,'did you ever wonder if dennis rodman was actually from this planet ? \nor if sylvester stallone was some kind of weird extra-terrestrial ? \ni used to think that about my 7th grade english teacher , ms . carey . \nbut after seeing this movie , they may have confirmed my suspicions . \nas the story goes , at any time , there are over a thousand aliens living among us here on earth . \nthe men in black ( mib ) are the watchdogs that oversee the cosmic citizens , guardians of our beloved planet from nasty-tempered aliens , and secret service to the stars . \nbased in new york city ( where weird is the norm ) , the mib organization gives human form to our space-faring emigrants so that they may walk and live among us unnoticed . \nbut to enforce the laws of earth , the mib carry weapons that are powerful enough to meet or exceed destruction quotas in one single blast . \nthey carry other-worldly technology to erase people\'s short-term memory when common folk see the mib in action . \nand their best leads on cosmic things-gone-awry are the supermarket tabloids . \nlittle do we know that there are much stronger battles of good v . evil going on in the depths of space . \none of the aliens-as-human on this planet is an important diplomat that is carrying something very precious . \nit holds the \'key\' , literally , to universal peace . \na giant cockroach-like alien soon arrives on the planet and steals this \'key\' . \nin the wrong alien hands ( flippers ? \nmandibles ? \ntentacles ? ) , it can be used as a weapon . \ntherefore , it must be recovered and returned to it\'s rightful owners . \notherwise , to ensure universal safety , earth will be destroyed , along with the \'key\' . \nnow , it\'s the mib who must prevent this catastrophe . \nthe mib agents on the case are \" k \" , played by tommy lee jones . \nhe is crustier than burnt toast and even more serious than al gore . \nthe stars in the sky no longer spark wonder in his eyes . \nhe is accompanied by a flippant rookie , \" j \" , played by will smith . \nbut , despite this shoot-em-up , protect-earth-from-destruction premise , this is nothing at all like a typical summer action movie . \nand , this isn\'t an independence day knockoff . \nrather , this is a stylishly offbeat sci-fi comedy that pokes fun at what the government always denies ? that there are real aliens that live here , and that the government does its darndest to cover them up . \nbut to give it some sense of excitement and to keep it within the parameters of the summer movie recipe , there must be some kind of earth-hangs-in-the-balance scenario . \nyet , this movie is very appealing . \nthe abundance of wierdness ( talking aliens , pee-wee atomizers , a mortician who \'lives\' for her work , and lots of yucky bugs and slime-splattering galore ) , is played straight , like as if this were normal ( of course , we are in nyc ) . \nit gives it a deadpan feel , which makes it all the more funnier and odder . \njones plays the venerable seen-it-all agent with seriousness and maturity . \nsmith is likeable and makes a great comic partner to jones\' straight man routine . \nthey click like dorothy\'s ruby red shoes . \nthe look and feel of the movie is made even better with direction from barry sonnenfeld ( the addam\'s family ) . \nthis guy has a knack for \'gothic\' comedy , and successfully transfers his macabre sense of humor onto the screen . \nand , an appropriate dose of special effects helps to bolster the oddness of their task without diverting attention from the human actors . \nthe story moves well , and before you know it , the end credits are already rolling ! \nthe result is 100 minutes worth of fun in the form of ewwwws and blechhhs , aaaahhhs and wows . \nlet the men in black protect and color your world . \n'

?,'ladies and gentlemen , payback is the most expensive episode of \" the equalizer \" i\'ve ever seen . \ngibson plays porter , a burglar shot and left for dead by his wife ( deborah kara unger , in an all-too-brief cameo ) and partner ( henry ) after a successful heist . \nas a morgue attendant sets about removing the bullets from porter\'s back , porter miraculously springs back to life . \nhe makes it his mission , as a walking dead man without a conscience , to exact revenge on those who screwed him and reclaim his share of the loot . \n ( in a running gag , porter demands $70 000 , but everybody mishears him and assumes he\'s after the entire $130 000 haul . ) \nin his travels ( or travails ) , porter encounters several other one-named villainous cretins like fairfax ( james coburn as a white-haired , millionaire thief ) and carter ( kristofferson , as a brown-haired , millionaire thief-the kingpin of the obligatory \" operation \" ) . \nhelgeland\'s film ( which was recut by mel the producer ) is devoid of an imperative dime store charm . \nthe novelty of seeing a big movie star mercilessly dispatching criminals wears off quickly : a ) because the bad guys can only be differentiated by their coifs , and b ) because mel\'s schtick doesn\'t evolve from act one-he\'s the terminator stranded in a plot without a sci-fi hook to keep us interested after the initial sadistic thrill is gone . \npayback should have been called playback : it\'s a 102-minute loop of the same short sequence . \n ( mel : \" i want my money . \" \nanonymous villain : \" no . \" \nmel shoots gun . \nanonymous villain dies . \nmel meets up with his hooker friend ( bello ) . \nsecond verse , same as the first . ) \nit\'s not porter\'s single-mindedness that robs the film of snap , crackle , and pop ; as a character who has already \" died \" once , he has nothing to lose and so much to gain . \nthe movie lacks danger . \nthe only thing porter is in jeopardy of is putting the audience to sleep . \npayback has a gritty , metallic look to it that also becomes monotonous ; its cinematography would be more appropriate in one of those bleak urban psychodramas that come out of england every couple of months . \n ( director of photography ericson core should have been fired early on for lighting bello , so va-va-va-voom in permanant midnight , to look like a potato in a gregg allman wig . ) \nto analyze such mediocrity is to grant payback far more attention than it deserves . \nperhaps only someone as experienced with antagonists-as-protagonists as tarantino-look what he did with the similar hero-less botched-robbery tale reservoir dogs-could have pulled off this material ( a loose remake of john boorman\'s point blank ) . \nthe movie presents us with the conventions of pulp fiction ( all women are femme fatales ; even the cops are in on it , etc . ) and crosses them with the conventions of cheesy tv crime melodramas ( death is never in the cards for the main character , etc . ) but transcends neither . \n'
?,'guilt . guilt is something i felt while watching basic instinct for the ninth time ; the penultimate t & a thriller , basic instinct made my last few teenage years worth living . \nbut i know so well that it\'s a terrible film , made by a terrible director incapable of feeling guilt . \nverhoeven went on to make the even more offensive showgirls and , on november seventh , 1997 , unleashed starship troopers to innocent moviegoers like me , who cannot control the urge to see giant bug movies . \nthe pic begins with the most unintentional laugh of the year . \na simple , white on black title card reads \" starship troopers \" -my friends and i speculated that the night before the prints were shipped , verhoeven realized he forgot the credits . \nis this how a hundred million dollar movie should open ? \nwere the rest of the film that subdued . . . \nstarship troopers is about a group of white , blond-haired himbos and bimbos who all have spanish last names . \nthey graduate high school , join the military , and then , rather curiously , decide to travel to an alien planet and destroy all lifeforms on that planet . \nthe story is so incomprehensible , and told so bombastically , it\'s akin to 129 minutes of someone screaming punishments at you in a foreign tongue . \n ( aside , club lovers will be happy to know that dance music hasn\'t changed in the future . ) \none plus : starship troopers contains some very funny sequences , specifically the newsreels of the future . \nhysterically funny , actually . \nbut the cynicism of these reports left me curious as to whether verhoeven felt pessimistic about the story in between . \nthe storytelling lacks focus , to say the least . \nthe politics of the film are scary . \nthe actions of the major female characters are dictated by their out-of-control libidos . \nthere\'s even a creepy sex scene : the lovely dina meyer makes out , nude , with the sickening van dien while half her face is covered by her opaque sweater , just the way he seems to like it . \ni use the term sickening because van dien is the least appealing actor i\'ve encountered in a big budget picture ; all chiseled features and machismo , he even barks a eulogy at a funeral like military orders . \nof course , verhoeven\'s probably the one to blame , and perhaps i\'m jealous because i\'m so disgusting . \nat any rate , a movie called starship troopers shouldn\'t be about sex . \nexactly ten years ago , verhoeven made robocop , which was about nothing but skillfully made and oddly moving . \nand r-rated , despite its goofy premise . \nmaybe it\'s asking too much for verhoeven to make a pg-movie , then-he\'s a master of insipid violence . \nhowever , ten year old boys would adore starship troopers if they could see it . \n'
?,'historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s . \nfor many critics , scholars and , most importantly , film producers , it was a thing of the past - something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black-and-white television and non-cgi special effects . \nbut in 1995 , same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago , there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor , producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre . \nand , same as in the case of dances with wolves , he was awarded for his effort with \" oscars \" . \nthe name of the film was braveheart , and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson . \nthe plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace ( 1272 - 1305 ) . \nin his time , english king edward i \" longshanks \" ( played by patrick mcgoohan ) has almost completely subdued entire british isles , including scotland , whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by \" ius primae noctis \" and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights . \nalthough english had killed his father many years ago , young scottish commoner william wallace ( played by mel gibson ) doesn\'t care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron ( played by catherine maccormack ) . \nmurron\'s death changes that and wallace takes arms and , together with small but dedicated band of followers , begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country . \nthrough time , more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace\'s rag-tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge . \nbut the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves , especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce ( played by angus macfadyen ) , who wouldn\'t like to have a simple commoner as a national leader . \nbraveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson , so it wouldn\'t be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann . \nhowever , even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre . \nthe most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism . \nwhile older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale-like vision of picturesque castles , splendid costumes and knights in shining armour , gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard , short and brutish . \nthis general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle , where hand-to-hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details , never seen since verhoeven\'s ultra-naturalistic flesh & blood . \ncompared with this naturalistic approach , most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays . \nbraveheart also employs humour at the right places , not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences , but also to underline its down-to-earth atmosphere , so different from previous historical epics . \nwhat makes braveheart \" larger than life \" is his protagonist . \nmel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and , as a result , character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero . \nwallace is more than superior to his enemies , both physically and mentally , yet he is able to show his sensitive , more vulnerable side . \nnaturally , when the character is based on epic poems , most of historical accuracy is going down the drain ( which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s ) . \nhowever , even those who don\'t particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace , especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel ( played by sophie marceau ) and make her a child . \nbecause of that the disbelief is hardly suspended , and final scenes aren\'t as effective as they should be . \nmel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful , and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors . \nmost memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan , whose cold , calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema . \nbrendan gleeson ( who would later become famous for his role in boorman\'s general ) is also very good as wallace\'s trusted companion , as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy-stricken king john balliol . \ndavid o\'harra is very entertaining as wallace\'s irish ally , and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience-stricken character of robert the bruce . \nwomen in this film have rather thankless roles , especially marceau as one-dimensional french princess . \ncatherine mccormack as wallace\'s wife was more interesting , but she was eliminated from the picture early on . \nfrom the technical point of view , the film is also very good . \nphotography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen . \non the other hand , the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern-day instruments for period piece set in medieval times . \nalthough mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike , braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism . \nthe main reason for that was the fact that gibson , among many historical facts , chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of \" longshank \" \'s son prince edward ( played by peter hanly ) . \nhe is not only presented as a villain , but also as one of the less competent in villain\'s camp - and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in \" politically correct \" hollywood . \nto make things even more obvious , good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward - rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives\' common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals . \nhowever , although the message of this film might look right-wing , it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century . \naccording to that ideology , oppressed classes ( workers , peasants ) are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and , as such , they are more radical , less willing to make compromises and more efficient ; on the other hand , privileged classes ( aristocracy , bourgeoisie ) are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges . \nthis marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety . \nin the end , whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic , braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre . \n'

\nthe love sub-plot * must * have had footage cut out . \nthe highlander and ramirez both seemed aware of powers they had never mentioned before . \nputting our heroes in deadly situations and then having them walk away because of some new power is very annoying . \ni still want to know why connor\'s coat becomes flame proof when he is immortal ! \nwe are not given enough time on zeist to believe in it , nor are we told why advanced aliens still use swords to kill . \nwhy not dynamite or laser saws or just plain bullets followed by a quick chop to the neck ? \ni know the head needs to come off but you could at least immobilise your opponent with laser rifles first . \nto be fair one assassin tried this but he must be the world\'s worst shot . \nmeanwhile connor develops luke-skywalker-like powers of laser beam deflection . \nas for \" bad guys , \" we see a rebellion on zeist , crushed easier than a grape and then the rest of the plot depends on katana being obsessed with killing mccleod in case he returns to zeist . \ntwo assassins are sent , presumably they are meant to be good at killing but an aged connor kills them both with no problems . \nno more assassins are sent . \nkatana , supposedly a very powerful man goes himself to kill connor . \nhas he no more assassins ? \nhas he no better ? \nwhy was the rebellion crushed so easily then ? \nmichael ironside is totally unconvincing ( bring back the kurgan ) . \nhe seems like a cartoon character and really isn\'t that evil , just stupid and violent . \nwe see the hollywood trick of the chief nasty threatening a child again and killing lots of innocents . \nyet he still seems like no threat -- perhaps because he seems too stupid to threaten connor , or maybe because his two best assassins wouldn\'t have been amiss with larry , curly and mo . \nso much for plot and characters . \nthe music is atrocious . \nit is at best intrusive and at worst annoying . \nbring back queen . \nthere was an audible sigh ( of relief ? ) \nwhen connor played a queen track in a juke box . \ni believe this at least is to be corrected for the american release . \nthe acting is at best flat , except for mr . connery . \nlambert is uninteresting and when he delivered \" there can be only one \" this time around it just made me wish there had only been one -- highlander . \nmichael ironside is unconvincing ; sorry , michael , i usually like you and everyone else was incredibly forgetable . \nso why 2/10 ?

?,'in one scene from \" the people vs . \nlarry flynt , \" the hustler magazine publisher appears at a self-staged free speech rally . \nas graphic photos flash on a huge screen behind him , flynt strides confidently across the stage , delivering a rousing speech over what really constitutes obscenity . \nthe spectacle was reminiscent of the scene in \" patton \" where the general spoke in front of a giant american flag . \nboth scenes were stirring , larger than life , richly entertaining , and felt totally like contrived set pieces for big hollywood movies . \noverall , that sums up \" the people vs . \nlarry flynt . \" \nthe film is a wildly entertaining hoot which , despite being based on fact , feels like a big , phony hollywood movie . \nthe son of a kentucky moonshiner , flynt ( woody harrelson ) ran away from home and ended up operating strip clubs in cincinnati . \nthere he met althea leasure ( courtney love ) , a bisexual stripper who became his fourth wife and the love of his life . \nto bolster interest in his clubs , he started a sexually explicit newsletter that grew into hustler magazine . \nflynt , along with the magazine\'s rag-tag management team , headed by his brother jimmy ( played nicely by woody\'s real-life brother , steak & shake commercial veteran brett harrelson ) , viewed playboy magazine with contempt . \nthey mocked its slick articles and airbrushed photos , striving to keep hustler focused on \" what guys really want , \" explicit photos that would make a gynecologist squirm , and extremely crude humor . \nthe film\'s prime example of hustler\'s attitude is a cartoon depicting characters from the wizard of oz in an orgy , giving the audience an opportunity to giggle at flynt\'s \" naughtiness . \" \ndirector milos forman conveniently ignores the magazine\'s frequent attempts to derive humor from child molestation , racism , and endless scatological cartoons . \nflynt\'s rag labored in well-deserved obscurity until he published nude photos of jacqueline onassis , which brought the magazine international attention , big money and the attention of conservatives . \nan obscenity bust followed , the first in a long series of battles between flynt and the law . \nlawyer alan isaacman ( edward norton ) enters the scene , hired by flynt\'s wife . \nnorton , an exceptional actor , is wonderful as the beleaguered lawyer trying to navigate the legal system while dealing with flynt\'s increasingly childish and bizarre behavior . \nin court , we meet the sputtering conservatives , headed by citizens for decency leader charles keating ( james cromwell . ) \nas keating blathers about flynt\'s immorality , the camera slowly moves in for a close-up of his name tag , inviting the audience to gloat at the notion of morality being trumpeted by keating , who was later convicted in a $2 billion s&l fraud . \nflynt\'s other prime foe is rev . jerry falwell , who sues over a hustler parody involving him and his mother having sex in an outhouse . \ntragedy strikes as flynt is shot by a would-be assassin , leaving him paralyzed from the waist down . \na dark period follows , as flynt and leasure hole up in an l . a . suite , strung out on pain killers . \nflynt eventually kicks drugs , but leasure succumbs to addiction , and later , aids . \nafter watch falwell on tv , describing aids as a punishment from god , flynt directs his lawyer to take the falwell case to the supreme court , leading to the film\'s climactic courtroom scene . \n \" the people vs , larry flynt \" is at its weakest when moralizing on free speech and lionizing flynt . \n \" if they\'ll protect a scumbag like me , then they\'ll protect all of you , \" declared flynt . \nhe\'s right , of course , but the director forman cheats in portraying the opposition as little more than hypocritical buffoons . \nhe also cheats in casting woody harrelson as flynt . \nharrelson is an attractive , charismatic man , and his strong performance paints flynt as a colorful folk hero . \neven a cursory look at the real flynt , who is making the talk show circuit , and plays the judge in an early courtroom scene , shows a bloated , morose and bitter man . \nan accurate portrayal of flynt would have made a more difficult film to watch , but a richer one . \ndespite its flaws , \" flynt \" is a fast moving , rousing movie with some terrific acting , especially by courtney love , whose vibrant performance will likely garner an oscar nod . \nthe story may be candy-coated , but it\'s still delicious candy . \n'
?,'the bond series is an island in the film world ; where else would we look forward to cliches , and all of the other things that occur in most of these films ? \nwhere else would pure escapism , a vulnerable hero , the \" talking villains , \" blatant product placement , predictable action sequences , and lots of promiscuity be hoped for instead of a significant change ? \ni don\'t understand it myself , but that\'s what the bond series is based on . \nfor ( i think ) 18 films , we\'ve mostly got the same thing over and over again , with some variation ( and a bit of change , most notably in the two dalton films ) . \nbut even i , a king of cynicism , can\'t bitch about it . \nand \" tomorrow never dies , \" the ( again , i think ) eighteenth bond film , and second brosnan bond film , is no exception . \nthank god ! \nthe plot , as in most of them , is pure balderdash , but seems to have a nice kind of edge to it . \ninstead of just plain billionaire psychotics , we get a rupert murdoch-esque media mogul/psychotic - elliot carver ( jonathan pryce , looking bitching with a white-haired cru cut , and always talking like he\'s out of breath ) , who has the admittingly ingenius idea of getting ratings by creating a war . \nno , this is not \" wag the dog \" - he wants a real war , between china and england , and is stupid enough to put the coverage out before anyone else discovered it . . . in \ncomes bond . \njames is sent all around the world , trying to do research on carver , fighting with his men , and running into ( on more than one occasion ) a chinese secret agent like him : wai lin ( michelle yeoh , asian action star extraordinaire . . . and \nco-star of \" supercop , \" nearly stealing the screen from jackie chan in that one ) . \nthe two eventually , and predictably of course , begin working together , and yes , there is some sexual tension between the two . \nluckily , their relationship is never strained , and she never gives into his cassanova-ness until the finale . \nthank god again . \nin every bond film , james bags , on average , three women ( sometimes more , sometimes less - the latter being more potent towards the aids-cautionary dalton ) , and he doesn\'t spoil this one ( though we never see them , of course - i mean , they need to stay around a pg-13 rating ) . \nthere\'s always one at the beginning with some chick we never see again , the big bond girl ( yeoh ) , and this time we have an almost-cameo by teri hatcher as carver\'s wife , paris , who , it seems , was once one of the girls he bags at the beginning . \nyes , teri\'s very attractive , but she seems kind of dull . \nof course , it\'s not really her fault ; her part is under-written , and she\'s only in a small part of it . \noh well . \nand there are always the big henchmen , the guys who do the dirty work for the polished big villains . \nthis time we get a tall , arian-looking ( not to mention robert shaw in \" from russia with love \" -looking ) guy named stamper ( goetz otto ) , who is pretty awesome , although a bit stiff ( well , mostly his posture , really ) . \nand for a bit of comedy , we get a cameo from vincent shiavelli as a german or austrian assassin who is ordered to do in bond at one point . \nthe government people have small parts , as usual , with q ( desmond llewelyn , looking near death , sadly ) getting only one scene ( in a more grouchy mood than usual ) , and m ( judi dench ) , getting more than m usually gets ( i mean , it is judi dench ) . \nand for no reason whatsoever , except \'cause he was so good in \" goldeneye , \" joe don baker shows up again as wade , admitting he has no reason for being there , and is this time more annoying . \nagain , oh well . \nthe action sequences are not a let-down , although sometimes go on too long . \nthey pop up every now and then , mainly because they have to ( for the sake of the series ) , and some significant ones are the opening one , one in a garage with a bmw that runs on remote control , and a motorcylce chase ( on a bmw cycle , nonetheless ) through china streets ( or was it vietnam . . . the \nplot\'s not really essential ) . \nthey\'re more high-tech , and feature much more laughs , which , yeah , i dig . \nso what if they\'re distracting ; they\'re supposed to be ! \nthe acting , from most around is great . \nyeoh is , actually , one of the better bond girls , mainly because she\'s so unique . \nthe better bond girls are more independent , and have a certain wily-ness to them . \npussy galore , with her homoerotic undertones and all , is one of the best , and diana rigg , who married bond at the end of \" on her majesty\'s secret service \" only to be killed , added some emotional depth . \nyeoh is notable since she\'s so active , and has great chemistry with brosnan . \npryce is an awesome villain , being slimy and lovable at the same time . \nand brosnan is , once again , the mack daddy . \nthe bond series is built on cliches , mainly because they\'re so fun and add to the escapism . \nif you can remember the dalton years , and they\'re serious direction , you remember how unsuccessful they were , both financially and aesthetically . \nthe series would falter if bogged down with too much plot , too many themes , and too much characterization . \ni don\'t really understand it myself , yet i\'m one of the bigger fans of the series in the northeast united states . \nhaving seen all of them more than once ( yes , i\'ve seen this twice already ) , you can tell i adore them . \nwhile it\'s not one of the best , like \" goldfinger \" or \" from russia with love , \" \" tomorrow never dies \" is nonetheless a truly awesome installment , even if not being as fully amazing as some of the better ones . \n'
?,'kids today , they don\'t just want to see heartthrob and master thespian freddie prinze jr . loving on the ladies . \nno , they want to see him doing something that takes a little more in the acting department : namely , playing baseball . \nthrough a series of drippy voiceovers , we are informed that there\'s no better proving ground for major league baseball than the cape cod summer baseball leagues , where college also-rans and hopeful dropouts go to play in the hopes of attracting big league attention . \nour man freddie has landed a spot as a pitcher on the prestigious chatham a\'s , where he is hoping for his big break . \nit\'s only after he is given ample time to show off his abs and scamper about in a woman\'s thong ( don\'t ask ) that we learn what the real story of summer catch will be : that prinze is a poor townie named ryan dunne , struggling to make a name for himself ; that neither his father ( fred ward ) nor brother ( jason gedrick ) pulled themselves out of their blue collar jobs and resent anyone who tries ; and that the local beauty tenley -- tenley ! \n ( jessica biel ) -- is so far out of his league that he probably shouldn\'t even bother . . . \nbut of course he makes a play for her . \nsummer catch also makes an abortive stab at another half a dozen subplots -- the jealousy of fellow townie and brazen slut dee dee ( brittany murphy ) , the alienation felt by ryan\'s non-baseball playing best friend ( gabriel mann ) , or the fat chick fetish of fellow player miles ( marc blucas ) . \nworst of these is a ludicrous bit involving that \'70s show\'s wilmer valderrama and beverly d\'angelo , both of whom appear in the film simply to provide a nutty mrs . robinson-like substory and to remind you of how much better done that was in bull durham . \nin fact , virtually all of summer catch feels like it\'s been done better somewhere else . \nfor starters , the film has a major question of identity . \nit\'s definitely not a sports movie , and it fails pretty miserably at being a romance . \nthe worst part is the amateurish script ( co-written by an arli$$ writing alumnus and a guy that starred in leprechaun 3 ) , chock-full of phony emotion . \nby the end , it all becomes a platform for each character to deliver a soliloquy to ryan that he must take to heart . \ndad is on hand to give fatherly yet drunken advice . \ncoach ( brian dennehy , just loving the fact that he\'s got some work on the big screen ) is on hand to give the curmudgeonly counterpoint . \nryan\'s catcher ( matthew lillard , playing himself again ) is on hand to tell ryan to \" play catch \" with him and make fun of the fat fetish guy . \nryan\'s stoner best friend is on hand to give the go-get-\'em-tiger-we\'re-behind-you talk . \nand the girlfriend is on hand to give heartwarming-nuzzly-follow-your-dreams counsel . \nbefore long , you start to wonder : is freddy prinze jr . is capable of having a thought of his own ? \ndon\'t answer that . \nthe only real joy in the film is found in biel\'s character , and not just because of the skimpy outfits , which are also usually wet . \nshe\'s the only one in the movie that is able to do much with her role , taking the rebelling-against-daddy character to at least a passing grade . \nwhen she\'s on screen , the time flies by . \nwhen she\'s not , you realize that for some ungodly reason this movie is almost two hours long . \nfor a pg-13 teen romance ( despite near-constant sexual innuendo ) , one has to ask warner brothers : what were you thinking ? ? ? \nfor her part , biel has fallen so far from her 7th heaven roots that she has almost become denise richards . \nhollywood is either about to eat her alive . . . \nor vice versa . \neither way , good luck , jessica . \nas for freddie , if he keeps pumping teen romances out at the rate of two a year , prinze\'s next \" summer catch \" is liable to be a venereal disease . \n'
?,'it\'s been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller , where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters , but it\'s been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually * shock * cared for the characters , not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles , flaws , and strengths to emerge so radiantly . \ni\'d saw that it\'s been at least a couple decades , even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers , though i\'m hardly comparing \" a simple plan \" to , say , \" rear window \" or \" strangers on a train . \" \nyet it\'s almost as good . \nit\'s simple , yet strangely complex , and astonishingly rewarding , because instead of moving from plot point to plot point , and merely laying out they-might-be-caught overtones , it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to , all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral . \nelegantly directed by sam raimi ( yes , the same ) , \" a simple plan \" concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright , moderately financially stable working man ( bill paxton ) , his dim-witted brother ( billy bob thornton ) , and his drinking buddy ( brent briscoe ) . \nwithout anyone around , and the possibility that no one would come looking for it , the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes , they will keep it , but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking , and so they generally don\'t flaunt anything they don\'t want to flaunt , they\'ll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton . \nthe possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse : a ) they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities ; b ) they could try to fight off the rightful owners , who are either villainous or just ; or c ) they could fight amongst themselves . \n \" a simple plan , \" though borrows a little from each of these . \na little tiff with the cops here , a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent ( a chilling gary cole ) there ) , and a bit of inside feuding over here . \nbut , as austin powers would say , that\'s not necessarily its bag ( baby ) . \nwhat i most admired about this film , and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that it\'s successfully able to have its cake and eat it too . \nit effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches , like the ones mentioned above , but at the same time , it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag . \nso while steps are taken to neatly cover things up , and these subsequent steps go miserably awry , the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to , they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity . \nin one early scene , paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesn\'t look like it was all stolen ( not a bad idea ) , when thornton screws up ( as he does continuously throughout the movie ) , and paxton has to do some major covering-up ( read : homicide ) . \ninstead of a quick murder and immeadiate hands-washing , raimi shows a lengthy , painful shot from a low-angle onto paxton\'s face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion . \nthere\'s a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he\'s committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective , but the previous shot is even better : more morally complex and more gut-wrenching . \nin short , probably the best piece of direction raimi\'s ever done , demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results ( for further proof , watch \" persona \" \'s \" sex scene \" and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman\'s ever done ) . \nbut the film hardly stops here ; it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof . \nyet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story . \nwhen the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical ( with aid from his pregnant wife , played by bridget fonda , a pal to raimi ) , he does , and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights . \nthere\'s at least two grand shootouts , and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history , and when they arrive , they don\'t come with masochistic delight but with cringe-inducing horror . \nduring the one , i was actually sinking into my chair , with the mantra \" they can\'t do this , can they ? \" \nstreeming through my head . \nin fact , this film , which is getting many comparisons to the coen\'s [superior , but forget about it] \" fargo , \" has many similar moments of manic insanity , attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what , in other hands , would be over-the-top distractedness ( imagine , i suppose , robert rodriguez directing this . . . then \nagain , after seeing the \" evil dead \" films , i\'d hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off , although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed \" raimi \" moments , a rifle-shot notwithstanding ) . \ninstead , raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch , easily letting the story and characters co-exist , while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out , like some offbeat comic touches . \nmost particularly , billy bob thornton\'s character , jacob , is a brilliant creation . \nhis dim-wittedness is often hilarious ( for most of the film , every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter ) , but there\'s authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we\'re not totally laughing at him . \nthe chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full-condescension because thornton is so damn real . \njacob\'s a multi-dimensional character , and while being stupid , we see that as not so much a flaw , but a strength to his character : his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system , primarily towards the middle where his bud and co-conspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money . \nthe final third of the film spends much time with him , and many of the touches upon his character , not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b . smith ( adapting his own book , by the way ) are just great . \ni particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend , told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near-sweetness and further strength of his saddened character . \nthornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance , by far the best performance he\'s ever given and further proof that he\'s the best character actor in contemporary cinema ( if you don\'t believe me , go back and watch his wonderful performance in \" primary colors , \" a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadn\'t been in the same year ) because he\'s easily able to slip into a character , and make him completely and utterly believable . \nhe brings so much weight to the film that , as it is with most character actors , it\'s difficult picturing anyone else in the role . \nthe rest of the cast is great too , from paxton\'s declining working man to chelcie ross\' amiable town sheriff . \neven fonda shows off her talents nicely . \nand if i had any complaints about the film , it\'s that the plot is almost too simplistic , and that at times , it seems too much like an exercise , like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved . \nand the occasional narration is , as it usually is , annoying ( narration should be used with extreme caution , especially when you\'re trying to set things up and/or express emotions - didn\'t raimi watch the first murder scene ? ) . \nand , the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie , the ending is basically amiss . \ni won\'t reveal it , but it\'s way too cruel and too much of an outsider set-up , as if the appearance of a plane wasn\'t already too much of that anyway . \nfor a film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved , this is the wrong ending . \nimagine a character-controlled ending ; otherwise , it\'s like if in \" crime and punishment \" if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing . . . not that i\'m at all comparing \" a simple plan \" to dostoevsky . \nthe ending does work , despite my protestations , but to me , there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it ; but if you had no qualms and were happy as a clam with it , then just ignore me and go about your day . \nbut despite my mere claims , make no mistake that i was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout , and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured , not because of any kind of gore factor ( which is , thankfully for this , very minimal ) , but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that i\'ve frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile . \nat least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece . \n'
?,'some of my friends who went to live in usa complain about one thing - that country is very different from the one depicted in hollywood movies . \nthat is especially true for those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find , to their big surprise , that the majority of people vote republican , go to church every sunday and usually don\'t tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american film . \nsuch rude awakening , however , can happen in another direction - conservative people are sometimes forced to discover unpleasant truths about world they live in . \nsomething like that happens to jake van dorn ( george c . scott ) , successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with the rest of his community . \none day his daughter kristen ( ilah davis ) disappears from calvinist youth convention in california . \nvan dorn is worried because he doesn\'t believe that his daughter would run from home . \nhowever , the truth delivered by private investigator andy mast ( peter boyle ) is even harder - kristen is spotted in cheap pornographic film . \ninfuriated van dorn is unsatisfied with the way mast\'s investigation is going , so he goes to los angeles to search for kristen himself . \nunfortunately , he lacks experience and the quest , that brought him to the utter depths of sex underworld , is fruitless . \nthings change when he devises cunning plan and , while doing it , stumbles on sympathetic prostitute and part time porno actress nicky ( season hubley ) . \nalmost two decades after its release , hardcore is mostly forgotten by critics and film scholars . \nit is a real shame , because very few movies in today\'s hollywood would dare tackle controversial issues that writer and director paul schrader explored in his second directorial attempt . \nin late 1970s , it was totally different situation - films were expected to have mature , serious themes for the mature audience . \nfor schrader this film was nice opportunity to expand the subplot of his previous work , taxi driver - one that deals with the great generational divide that tormented the american society in 1970s . \non one side we have an old america that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard work and strict morals that made that country great . \nbut that america is obviously unable to cope with the new challenges brought by the social turmoil in 1960s and , instead of facing them , prefers to live in rural , conservative cocoons . \nthe new america , on the other hand , fares no better - ideals of the so-called \" sexual revolution \" , same as all other \" revolutions \" of the swinging sixties , degraded into exploitation and depravity . \ninstead of being \" liberated \" , baby boomers are stuck with their own inability to cope with the newly discovered freedoms . \nschrader very cleverly brings the idea that those two americas , actually , aren\'t so far away - nice example is a brilliant scene in which van dorn , already described as an authoritarian and paternalistic capitalist , meets sleazy porno producer ; the latter one also turns out to be authoritarian , paternalistic and very dedicated to this job . \nthe difference between the two is simply in the line of work . \nmany contemporary critics actually accused schrader of promoting conservative agenda . \non the surface , it may look that way - audience is forced to sympathise with van dorn and his quest . \nin the first scenes , he is portrayed as nice family man who actually doesn\'t deserve to experience parent\'s worst nightmare . \nthe scene in the porno cinema that reveals kristen\'s fate is extremely cruel ; pain and humiliation , brought by oscar-winning actor george c . scott , is of such intensity , that the audience feels sorry for him and simply must support his agenda . \nvan dorn is perhaps flawed , and the subtle hints lead to the unflattering truth at the end ; but the viewers simply know that his cause is just , and that prodigal daughter must be better off with her loving father than with the sleazy pornographers that only want to exploit her body . \non the other hand , schrader , who grew up in an environment very much like van dorn\'s ( his own parents wouldn\'t allow him to watch movies until he was 18 ) , knows better and tries to bring another side of coin . \neven the people connected with sex underworld can show redeeming qualities - like nicky , who actually tries to improve her life , and sleazy detective who develops something like a conscience at the end . \nunfortunately , schrader fails to erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning , and his attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of america seems lost in somewhat clich ? d finale . \nthe script is slightly flawed , and schrader as director doesn\'t show too much originality - his style seems too influenced by techniques that scorsese used in taxi driver . \napart from the scenes in grand rapids , those two films even look alike . \nbut the content might be more than interesting for today\'s viewer , especially those inspired by the current 70s revival . \nuntil boogie nights , no hollywood mainstream movie ever dared to explore the phenomenon of pornography in 1970s . \nhardcore , on the other hand , might serve as precious document , because it depicts sex film industry in the period often regarded as the golden age by connoisseurs - before the advent of video , when many of the porno filmmakers could afford to think of themselves as artists . \nthe view of such age and the industry is very unflattering , though , but for the film whose main character takes time to explain calvinist doctrines to the audience , that shouldn\'t be too surprising . \nanyway , despite some flaws , hardcore remains very interesting and powerful piece of cinema . \n'
?,'the promotion for fear and loathing in las vegas ? has made the film out to be a comedy , and for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one . \nit\'s 1971 , and the hippie movement has left behind quite a few wash-outs , among them journalist raoul duke ( johnny depp ) and his \" attorney \" dr . gonzo ( benito del toro ) . \nthese two spend most of the film in a drug-induced stupor , having strange hallucinations , trashing their hotel rooms , and either annoying or scaring almost everyone that crosses their path . \nduke is first assigned to cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race in las vegas , but gets lost in a blur of drugs , beer , and flying dust , and ends up wandering around with no clue who won . \nhe leaves vegas briefly before he is sent back , in what can only be described as a strangely appropriate twist of fate , to cover a drug enforcement conference . \nfear and loathing has been misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use of drugs . \nit doesn\'t , even in the beginning--while the pair\'s antics are sometimes amusing and relatively harmless at first , the humor here is still fairly dark . \ndirector terry gilliam views them with a rather satirical eye , and even when we\'re laughing , we\'re laughing at them rather than with them . \nthey spend most of their time paranoid , angry , or just plain befuddled , which is probably an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill up with giant reptiles . \nthe black comedy may be entertaining to watch onscreen , but it\'s probably not something most other audience members would want to experience first-hand . \nall this aside , i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its one-hour mark , thinking to myself that i wanted something more out of this than just an off-kilter satire of drug culture . \nthankfully , the script delivers it before too long , as duke , in a rare moment of lucidity , stops to recall how he was once an enthusiastic hippie , \" riding the wave \" of something that seemed special and important . \nnow it\'s six years later and the wave has finally broken , as he puts it . \nmaterialistic culture is still alive and well and , for most of this film , right in his face in las vegas ; the \" american dream \" of which duke occasionally speaks is still just as shallow and phony as ever . \nthe social protesters have lost , and the more questionable aspects of the movement have turned ugly and left casualties such as duke to drift in a sea of drugs and disillusionment . \nin many ways , fear and loathing is gilliam\'s most reality-based film ; all of his others , with the exception of the fisher king , have made use of some sort of fantasy or science-fiction plot elements . \nyet it is his off-the-wall masterpiece brazil ? to which this film bears the most visual resemblance . \nthe protagonist of brazil found himself alternately surrounded by a plastic , soulless society and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections and terrorist attacks , and similarly duke\'s world is composed of the artificial , empty glam of las vegas and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations . \nunlike the protagonist of brazil , however , duke is not a particularly admirable figure , and neither is gonzo . \nduring the latter half of the film , their trips turn nastier and the consequences worse , eventually building up to an incident an a diner in which gonzo crudely frightens and humiliates a waitress , while duke , though he doesn\'t seem to approve , doesn\'t do anything to stop it either . \nby the time this scene takes place , they don\'t seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more ; they just seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner . \nduke seems to realize at some level that he\'s become something he doesn\'t like , but he\'s either too apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change . \nthis film has taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at the audience . \nwhile gilliam may have overdone it in a few places , i think he and his co-writers deserve more credit than that . \nthere\'s plenty of substance here , particularly in the second half ; its observations about the broken and defeated rebels from the \'60s and the objects of their rebellion just aren\'t usually very pleasant . \nunlike , say , brazil ? or the fisher king , both of which feature a character who dares to let himself dream in a repressive environment , fear and loathing in las vegas ? shows us someone who\'s given up on his dreams and resorts to the quick fix of drugs . \nin its own psychedelic , whacked-out way , it\'s sad and regretful , but i think it\'s also a bit of a kick in the pants , a challenge to find an alternative between chemically-induced withdrawal and the equally addictive drug of vegas-style materialism . \nindeed , duke himself admits at one point that he\'s never learned to accept that you can get higher without drugs than with them . \ni\'m not sure if he\'s any closer to accepting it by the end or not , but i suspect the audience will get the idea . \n'
?,'james cmaeron\'s breakthrough feature was the first of his films to showcase his obsession with technology and more specfically technology run amok . \nfor those of you who do not know the plot : in 2029 machines have engineered a nuclear for the expressed purpose of wiping out the human race . \nhuman survivors are systematically hunted down and destroyed . \nhowever , some humans are fighting back led by the heroic john connor . \nto stop connor , the machines send a terminator ( arnold schwarzenegger ) back to 1984 to murder connor\'s mother , sara ( linda hamilton ) , and thus prevent connor from ever being born . \nin response , the humans send a protector , kyle reese , played by michael biehn . \nimages of machines and of humans\' reliance on machines dominate the film . \neven though the characters know that the benign oil drillers of 1984 will become the ruthless hunter killers of 2029 , humans continue to use the machines . \nin the climax of star wars , luke relies on the force alone--his own spiritual power--to destroy the death star . \nin the terminator , however , sara must use another machine--a giant hydraulic press--to vanquish her enemy . \ncameron seems to be implying that this reliance on technology is inescapable--and he\'s not happy about it . \nunabated technological growth brings about the terminator\'s other obsession : the apocalypse . \nwe have plenty of imagery regarding armageddon : thousands of human skulls line the streets of future la . \nchildren watch the flames in a burning television . \nwhen the terminator arrives in 1984 an almost biblical lightning storm precedes him . \neven though the \" future is not set , \" there is no doubt about where the world is headed at the end of the movie : the machines will rise and the humans will have to struggle for their very existence . \nall sara can do is await it . \n ( cameron doesn\'t wimp out like he does in terminator 2 ) \nthe end of the world is the human race\'s own fault , too . \nafter all it is the humans that created in the evil machines in the first place . \nback in 1984 , when the cold war was still in full effect , the film must have been seen as a very apt metaphor for nuclear war ( another obsession of cameron\'s ) . \nthese days , one can read a criticism of machine-like behavior in humans . \ntrue , humanizing touches are put into paul winfield\'s and lance henriksen\'s detective characters , but the terminator is also able to move through the city undetected . \ncameron also draw parallels between the mechanical efficiency between the terminator and reese when they first arrive in 1984 la . \nfrom a technical standpoint the terminator is very well done . \narnold schwarzenegger is a perfect antagonist--unstoppable , merciless , obdurate . \nwe are not meant to empathize with this ultimate killing machine as we are in some of schwarzenegger\'s later works ( eg , commando ) , but fear him . \ncameron and hurd\'s script basically depicts a one hour and forty-five minute chase , taking a few moments here and there to explain time travel and develop the romantic subplot . \nwhile we do see the hackneyed dialogue cameron is now so well known for , there is also considerable suspense especially for the first time viewer who may be unsure of kyle reese\'s intentions . \ncameron directs the film at a rapid , kinetic pace . \neither the camera is moving or something within the frame is moving--usually both occurs . \nthe violence is not particularly graphic ( temple of doom\'s heart-pull scene outgrosses the terminator\'s ) , but it is brutally staged making it that much more effective . \nfor a low budget film , the terminator\'s special effects and art direction ( especially in 2029 la ) are remarkably well done . \nspecial mention should be made of the stop motion effects work at the end of the film depicting the terminator endoskeleton . \nit is some of the best stop motion i have ever seen . \none thing that doesn\'t hold up after all the years , however , is linda hamilton\'s hairdo . \n'
?,'the scene at the end of 1989\'s `dead poets society , \' when robin williams\' english students stand up on their desk and say , `captain , my captain , \' gets me every time . \nunfortunately , the court room scene near the end of robin\'s newest film , `patch adams , \' doesn\'t have anywhere near the same impact . \nfrom the surface `patch adams\' looks very promising . \nit\'s a story about a not so young man , patch adams ( robin williams ) , who finds meaning in his life through helping sick people . \nwhen the film opens , we find patch , depressed and suicidal , checking himself into a mental hospital . \nin a few scenes , strongly reminiscent of `one flew over the cuckoo\'s nest , \' he ends up helping the patients through their problems ; and it\'s here that he finds how much he loves working with people . \nso he checks himself out of the hospital , and heads straight to medical school . \nright from the start , patch uses comedy to help make the patient more comfortable . \nhe continuously breaks medical tradition and makes the dean of the school angry . \nshortly after joining medical school , he meets and falls in love with carin ( monica potter ) . \nthey , along with patch\'s dork friend , truman ( daniel london ) , start a medical clinic for uninsured people . \nonce the dean catches wind of the clinic , he tells patch he can\'t graduate and kicks him out of school . \npatch , like what any true american would do , takes the school to court . \nit\'s here where the not so climatic court room battle takes place , over whether or not patch can become a real doctor . \ni have never seen a movie with some potential just completely blow it . \nit seems more like a series of short sketches , rather than a full-length movie . \nconsidering it runs almost two hours , much too long for such a light film , it could have flowed much smoother . \nnot to mention the fact of how serious the film takes itself , and manages to cover all the cliches of bad melodrama . \nrobin williams saves the film from being abysmal with several comic scenes that elevate the movie to entertaining and worthwhile levels . \nbut those moments are rare and in the end `patch adams\' is barely average . \n'

?,'the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year . \nwe are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics , loved by the people , and make tons of money at the box office . \nthis year , the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 classic , the mummy . \ni have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies , and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them . \nthat tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza . \nin the mummy , the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick o\'connell . \nhe teams up with a curious , clumsy librarian named evelyn , played by rachel weisz , to find the mysterious city of the dead , hamunaptra . \nevelyn loves egypt , and would truly like to visit the city that people call a fable . \nrick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle , and that\'s why she chose him to lead her there . \nalso tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyn\'s brother , jonathan , played by john hannah ( sliding doors ) . \nnow in hamunaptra , the three uncover \" the book of the dead . \" \nthe curious evelyn unlocks the book , reads from it , and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep ( arnold vosloo ) becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who opened and read from the book . \nalong with imhotep arising from the dead , the ten curses of egypt become in full effect , launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out to find hamunaptra . \nnot only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him , he is also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt . \ndon\'t expect huge things out of the mummy , but just expect to have a good time . \nthis movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up special effects , which may turn off some viewers . \non the other hand , this type of film is one of my favorites , but that\'s up to you to decide . \nthere is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though . \nthe state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world . \nwe are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert , swarms of beetles and locusts , and even creatures crawling under a human\'s skin . \nthese may have been in other movies before , but not like in the mummy . \nas of now , the mummy holds the title for best special effects of this year , but all this could change when star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace is released into theaters across the country . \nin the past , brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles . \nwhen playing \" george \" in disney\'s george of the jungle , he was mainly not known by anyone . \ni would say that gods and monsters is the film that gave him a name , and now the mummy will give him a name amongst teens . \nin the mummy , fraser gets to play an action hero , and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role , as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle . \nalthough brendan fraser is great , rachel weisz gives the best performance among the cast . \nweisz really reminded me of a character from an old , horror film . \nthe way she acts , looked , and talked all reminded me of someone not from this time . \nevelyn is probably the only character that was likable , considering that the other characters , like john hannah\'s , didn\'t get much personal attention . \nin many films , when different genres are mixed , the mixing usually works , and i like it for the most part . \nin the mummy though , not all of the mixing works . \nthere are some scenes that have a lot of potential horror , some with potential comedy , some with potential drama , and some with potential pure action , but the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work . \nthe mummy could have gotten an \" a \" rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these . \ni didn\'t mind the corny one-liners here and there during action sequences , but it certainly could have done without them . \nthe cinematography is amazing in the mummy . \nparticularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt , we are taken into a very fun portrayal of egypt , mummies , and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians . \nthe costume design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography . \nfrom ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits , the costumes are always top notch . \nthe bottom line- with the mummy , the summer is off to its usually great start . \n'
?,'my son and i share a perverse predilection for bad movies . \nwe are amused and entertained by the cheap thrills , the corny dialog , the ludicrous premises and the bad acting . \nsince other family members aspire to higher forms of entertainment , we usually wind up indulging our proclivity together . \ni can\'t remember when we disagreed on the relative merits of a clunker until species 2 came along . \nhe was not amused . \ni on the other hand was able to easily suspend the applicable requirements in the usual manner and declare myself suitably entertained . \nperhaps the evident skills that were brought to the process of producing a bad product was what prevented him from extracting fun out of mediocrity . \ni on the other hand appreciated the fact that the producers and director knew exactly what they were doing : insulting my intelligence , and brought adequate movie-making skills to the project a movie does not have to be good to be well made , at least in terms of the craft . \nthe movie could have been better if it were not so brusque . \nthis movie slaps you with conception , pregnancy , delivery and young childhood in consecutive frames , without pausing for infancy . \nthe producers of nescafe have nothing on this alien race in which a woman\'s womb balloons immediately after the male orgasm , and a few seconds later a young child tears its way out of her abdomen in a sloppy and gory version of an inside-out cesarean . \nan autopsy scene in which a buzz saw cuts through the cranium was not the kind of indulgence that i condone , to say nothing of the fact that it was scientifically incorrect . \nin a real autopsy the saw does not cut through the scalp ; it is used only after the skull has been exposed . \nthe opening sequences of exploration of mars were very good . \nthe writers showed excellent skills for ceremonial speech writing but the spontaneous dialogue would qualify for a subtitle : `as bad as it gets\' . \nas the movie progressed i vowed to remember the lines that made me cringe but only one stuck . \neve ( natasha henstridge ) was cloned from sil , the original alien sexual predator , but her mating instinct was artificially attenuated , which was all that was needed to turn her into a noble and cooperative prisoner . \nin a wistful display of resignation and understanding she tells her friend and jailer ( marg helgenberger ) : `i think of all the places that i will never see and all the people that i will never meet . \' \nit\'s enough to melt the most callous heart . \nat another point she protests : `i\'m human too , you know . \' \nshe is only half right . \npeter medak , the director , knows his business . \njustin lazard as the doomed astronaut does nothing to enhance his hollywood credentials . \njames cromwell , his father , is perfect in a short role . \nmarg heldenberger , the dna scientist is pleasant and beautiful . \nnatasha is an exquisite ornament . \ngeorge dzunza knew and delivered what was expected of him as the dumb general that messes things up . \nmichael madsen was there . \nblack buddies do not usually survive in this type of movie but mykelti williamson manages to stay around for the final credits , which is more that we can say for lazard . . \n'
?,'in december of 1996 , a little movie called \" scream , \" was released , became a box-office smash , and resurrected films targeted at teens . \nfirst , it was teen slasher movies that were the big fad ( both \" scream \" movies , \" i know what you did last summer , \" \" urban legend , \" etc . ) , but just recently , the popularity has switched over to the teen comedy genre ( a \'la \'80s john hughes ) , starting with last june\'s \" can\'t hardly wait . \" \nit may be the first week of april in 1999 , but so far this year we have been given a movie aimed at the 25-and-under market almost every single week : \" varsity blues , \" \" jawbreaker , \" \" cruel intentions , \" \" simply irresistible , \" \" the rage : carrie 2 , \" and \" the mod squad . \" \ncoming april 9 are two more of this type : \" never been kissed \" and \" go , \" and on april 23 , we\'ve got the teen satire \" election \" and the teen horror-comedy \" idle hands . \" \njeesh ! \nout of all of these moves , however , the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation , \" 10 things i hate about you , \" is this past january\'s mediocre , ho-hum \" she\'s all that . \" \nalthough similar in plotting ( ok , darn near identical ) , \" 10 things i hate about you , \" a modern-day version of shakespeare\'s \" the taming of the shrew \" ( \" she\'s all that \" got its inspiration from \" pygmalion \" ) , is an infinitely superior film in every department , from the smart direction by first-time feature director gil junger to the charming and well-written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast , who give the best group of performances in a teen comedy since 1985\'s \" the breakfast club . \" \nand to top it all off , in the inevitable climax set at the prom , at least we didn\'t have to once again suffer through a goofy , inappropriate dance sequence ( who could forget , or want to remember , for that matter , this ludicrous development in \" she\'s all that ? \" ) . \nthe day wide-eyed , shy new student cameron james ( joseph gordon-levitt ) starts school at seattle-based padua high , he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore , bianca stratford ( larisa oleynik ) . \nalthough he doesn\'t know french , he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her , but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father ( larry miller ) won\'t allow her to date until her bitter , unconventional older sister , kat ( julia stiles ) , a senior , decides to . \nkat , of course , has sworn off the likes of boys , but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her , which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona ( heath ledger ) . \ncomplicating matters , cameron\'s dorky friend , michael ( david krumholtz ) , decides to use a wealthy jock , joey ( andrew keegan ) , who also has his sights set on bianca , as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him , and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey . \nas you can see , \" 10 things i hate about you \" includes a huge number of characters , some of which i haven\'t even mentioned , such as kat\'s shakespeare-obsessed friend , mandella ( susan may pratt ) and bianca\'s materialistic comrade , chastity ( gabrielle union ) . \nat a short , but well-used running time of 98 minutes , all of the characters are perfectly handled , satisfyingly developed , and , for the most part , are not treated as caricatures ( another flaw of \" she\'s all that , \" where the bad guys ( and gals ) ran around constantly saying , \" you\'re vapor \" ) . \nsince i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters , and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective , i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained . \naside from a good screenplay , it\'s the performances that can make or break a movie , and director junger has really hit the jackpot . \naside from joseph gordon-levitt ( \" 3rd rock from the sun \" ) , who gives his strongest performance to date here , none of the actors are that well-known , but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings . \nas the main character of kat , julia stiles ( last seen in the miniseries \" the \'60s \" ) is marvelous and always believable , and certainly has a bright future ahead of her . \neven though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hard-edged , it was easy to identify with kat\'s way of thinking ( she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath ) , and i completely admired her individuality . \nno one , i think , could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does . \nheath ledger , as the infamous bad-boy of the town , injects much life into patrick , and has a lot of chemistry with stiles . \none other actor of note is larisa oleynik who , with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith , is able to turn bianca into a person with multi-dimensions , even though she is accurately self-centered at the on-set . \nin one truthful scene , cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish , and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes , she has . \none off-beat element of the film , and a source of some hearty laughs , is the way that the school\'s staff act , which is strikingly unformal . \nallison janney , as the guidance counselor ms . perky , who is writing a trashy harlequin romance novel , is comic dynamite , as is daryl \" chill \" mitchell as the english teacher , who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and , at one point , sends kat to the office because , for once , she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good . \nalthough there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning , most of it actually works , especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters . \nin one very funny scene , chastity asks , \" i know people can be overwhelmed , and they can be underwhelmed , but can people just be . . . whelmed ? \" \nat another point , bianca and kat\'s father ( a stand-out larry miller ) , who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant , only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion : before she leaves , she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it\'s like to be pregnant . \n \" 10 things i hate about you \" once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre , and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the \'90s . \nit also helps that the movie has a perfectly-assembled soundtrack , mixing indie-rock with new wave \'80s songs ( and with , thank goodness , no rap ) . \nby the film\'s end , it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together , and i was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up , especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca , kat and her father , and a flawlessly-acted and moving sequence in which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class ( this is where the title comes from ) . \nluckily , i doubt i would be able to find ten things i hate about \" 10 things i hate about you , \" but the positive aspects of the film far out-number ten . \n'
?,'ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film ; i have a problem even regarding it as a film . \nit\'s more of a show , a big commercial for ted turner\'s world championship wrestling ( wcw ) . \nthe movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page , goldberg , and sting . \nthe story is very minimal and basic . \nthere are these two guys , gordy ( david arquette ) and sean ( scott caan ) . \nthey are two twenty-something wrestling fans from wyoming . \nwhen they go to a live event for the big match up , there favorite wrestler jimmy king ( oliver platt ) is defeated and his career is announced to be over by the mean commissioner titus ( joe pantoliano ) . \ngordy and sean decide to go on a quest to find jimmy and bring him back to the top and defeat the evil titus\' plans . \non the way , they meet some people , have some fun , and clean up some port-o-potties . \nsounds great huh , well it\'s not . \nthe movie makes many attempts at humor , only a few of them work . \nthe jokes that make you laugh , however , do not outnumber the film\'s many duds . \nthere is a funny repertoire between arquette and a convenience store cashier played by ahmet zappa . \nthe cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to get him back . \ni especially enjoyed one version in which they have a wrestling match and arquette\'s tag team partner is \'macho man\' randy savage . \nthey wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans and getting body slammed on the floor . \nthe other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette and rose mcgowan . \nmcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl , the cheerleaders of the wcw . \nshe becomes attracted to gordy and they have some nice , funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowan\'s breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face . \nnow what didn\'t work in this movie ? \nthat would be the rest of it . \nthe flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets . \nthe two lead characters work for a port-o-potty cleaning company and when they crash the truck , the excrements spill all over the road . \nit\'s not funny ; it\'s pathetic and brainless . \nthe film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their wrestlers but not all wrestling fans are that way . \ni watch it for entertainment and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie . \nthe main characters in the film actually get to wrestle , like that would happen to any fan , especially to 2 that stalk a wrestler and sneak him back onto set . \nalso , i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily ; they just walked right in . \ni like wrestling . \ni watch it at home and laugh . \nit\'s continuously funny and has great characters otherwise i wouldn\'t watch it . \nthis movie wasn\'t even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv . \nthe only fun i had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew . \nthe funny thing was that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn and chris benoit have left wcw for more money but are still featured in the film prominently . \nthe movie was too dim-witted to be funny . \nit is possibly the most useless and under-developed film ever . \na recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film , detroit rock city . \nthat movie was interesting , well done and continuously funny unlike this film . \nthe acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you laugh . \nnow that the scream trilogy is over , arquette has nothing else to do so he has to do crap like this and be a spokesman in those dumb 1-800-call-att ads . \nat least he has a hot wife in courtney cox . \nhe\'s in the funny parts of the film but there aren\'t enough to make him look good . \nthe music was bad also feature such overplayed tunes as kid rock\'s \" bawitdaba \" and \" cowboy \" . \nmartin landau has a great cameo as a classic , hard-nosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips the king back into shape to regain his throne . \nscript is important to a film but this piece of crap could have been made with a couple of scribblings on a napkin . \na fan of the wrestlers who are featured in the film probably wrote it . \nat times the movie even tries to show wrestling as real . \nthe wrestlers form alliances , go to people\'s houses and beat them up . \nit\'s utterly ridiculous . \nthe whole film was a wasteful , dumfounding experience . \nthe movie was made to pay homage to the fans , telling them things that made wrestling , not the wrestlers . \nthe wrestlers are making more money to make a movie to thank the fans for begin fans by paying 5 dollars to see a potty-humor movie . \nthe wcw sucks and this movie is just a pathetic two-hour commercial to watch it . \nif you\'re going to watch wrestling watch wwf , it\'s actually entertaining . \nthe wrestling is betters , they\'re funnier , more diverse , and have better entrance themes . \noh and the girls are hotter . \nis this what movies have become , 2 hour-long commercials that you have to pay to see ?

?,'renown surrealist director , the 77-year-old frenchman alain resnais ( hiroshima , mon amour/last year at marienbad/m ? lo ) , has created a lighthearted musical played as an homage to britisher dennis potter and his pennies from heaven ( 1978 tv serial , 1981 movie ) and the singing detective ( 1986 ) . \nthe film follows potter\'s gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lip-synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts . \nhe also follows the kind of sweet and colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved to direct , such as \" the umbrellas of cherbourg \" and \" the young girls of rochefort . \" \nthe tale has resnais\'s unique touches as a director to go along with his homage . \nit is a satire about class differences and falling in love with the wrong person , and that there is a song in everyone\'s heart for every occasion . \nwhat hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters , the songs are not memorable and stand little chance of being recognized by an american audience ( the exceptions might be the edith piaf and maurice chevalier numbers ) , and the farce seems more banal than daring . \nyet it is not without its striking moments and charms , such as when jane birkin does a cameo and sings one of her own songs . \nalso , the glossy amberlike photography added a very french romantic feeling to the story , while the mood of paris as being a place for love to flourish above all else , which has always been embellished in movie lore , comes through with flying colors . \nit also does a good job of showing you the way paris is in the 1990s and in the way ordinary people exist there . \nit tells the romantic story of six parisians who become intertwined with each other in their ordinary lives as they search for happiness . \nthey are the attractive sisters odile ( sabine az ? ma ) and camille ( agnes jaoui ) , with the older businesswoman odile married and decidedly set on a bourgeois life of material comforts . \nshe is married to the glum and laconic claude ( pierre arditi ) . \nshe once went out with a businessman , nicolas ( jean-pierre bacri ) , who left her 8-years ago and now shows up in paris and asks her help to find someone to rent a flat for his family . \nsimon ( andre dussolier ) works as a real-estate salesman and is trying to find nicolas a flat , in his spare time he writes radio plays . \nsimon\'s boss is the much younger , unscrupulous and arrogant marc duveyrier ( lambert wilson ) , who inherited the firm from his father and is the real-estate agent selling a more luxurious and larger flat with a better view to odile , but fails to tell her that a building project is going up soon that will block her view . \nscreenwriters and actors jean-pierre bacri and agnes jaoui wrote themselves the best parts . \njaoui\'s camille is a university scholar finishing up a ph . d . \nin history , using for her thesis the study of \'the yeomen in the year 1000 at lake paladru . \' \nshe works as a tour guide in the meantime and suffers from panic attacks , even though she appears to have outwardly perfect self-control . \non her tours for the last four years has been the much older simon , pretending to be doing research for his plays but really attracted to her , but not having the nerve to tell her this . \nto his dismay , he finds out she is dating his mean-spirited but handsome boss , whom she meets when looking at her sister\'s new place and seeing him crying but not realizing that it was from a cold , not because he\'s so sensitive . \nbacri as the classy nicolas , turns out to be now working as a chauffeur . \nhe is a hypochondriac with a history of depression who visits many doctors , until he finds one who tells him there is nothing wrong with him . \nodile still pines for him , but he\'s married , telling her he expects his wife to arrive shortly . \nlove is \'the same old song\' that makes the world go \'round , even when all the characters are liars and not exactly open to what their true motives are . \neverything comes together in a bourgeois housewarming party for odile\'s place , as the characters reveal their true feelings and all their deceptions and neurotic impulses are either uncovered or about to be . \nthere\'s not a lot of bite to this satirical musical , but resnais has never made a bad film and is one of the best current french directors , if not the best . \nthis film is not one his great ones , but it still has enough pep in its light touches to be interesting . \nit not only has an odd way for the characters to break into song but -- some males even sing in a female voice while some females sing in a male voice . \nit is also interesting in the way it examines its characters\' behavior as being similar in business as in love . \n'
?,'one of my brother\'s favorite movies is h . b . halicki\'s 1974 cult flick \" gone is sixty seconds , \" one of the best products of the car-chase genre that provided drive-in fare during the 1970\'s . \nchase pics had more tire squeals than dialogue , but they had a strong visceral appeal . \nalthough it boasts a bigger budget and familiar stars , the remake of \" gone in sixty seconds \" is relatively weak and dull . \nrandall \" memphis \" raines ( nicolas cage ) is a retired car thief who runs a go-cart track . \nhe got out of crime so that his younger brother kip ( giovanni ribisi ) would not take up boosting cars . \nhowever , kip became a thief anyway , and now he\'s in big trouble . \nkip promised to deliver fifty luxury and sports cars to gangster raymond calitri ( christopher eccleston ) by the end of the week . \ncalitri expects memphis to fulfill kip\'s bargain ; if he doesn\'t come through , kip dies . \nmemphis gathers his old crew ( angelina jolie , robert duvall , will patton , chi mcbride , and vinnie jones ) , and kip brings his boys ( t . j . \ncross , william lee scott , scott caan , and james duval ) . \nas if calitri breathing down their necks wasn\'t bad enough , the team is pursued by a cop ( delroy lindo ) who\'s still ticked off that he never busted memphis and by a rival gangster ( rap star master p ) who wants to take over calitri\'s clients . \nwatching \" gone , \" i discovered that stealing fifty cars is not any more interesting than stealing one . \nmaybe that\'s why the first forty-nine are fairly easy , and the thrills are saved for \" eleanor , \" a 1967 shelby gto , a model that has always eluded memphis . \nbut the big chase doesn\'t live up to the long wait . \ni had high hopes for \" gone \" because it is director dominic sena\'s second film . \n \" kalifornia , \" his 1993 debut , was a brilliant study in the relationship between violence and its audience . \nin that movie sena took a simple thriller plot ( a couple gives a serial killer a ride ) and successfully endowed it with deeper significance . \nin \" gone \" he seems to be aiming for a drama about two brothers who can\'t communicate with each other , but that goal just doesn\'t mesh with this plot . \n \" gone \" either takes itself too seriously or not seriously enough . \nit\'s not light enough to be fun , or mean enough to be intense . \nthis chaser has more dialogue than tire squeals but is none the better for it . \nthe lack of action is a waste of the premise , which should have challenged the filmmakers to create the most spectacular car chases ever . \nthe weak script is a waste of a talented cast . \nin a \" newsweek \" interview last year , sean penn blasted his old pal nic cage for making bad movies . \nmuch as i like cage , for every good picture he does ( \" leaving las vegas , \" \" bringing out the dead \" ) , there are two major stinkers ( \" snake eyes , \" \" con air , \" \" 8mm , \" \" city of angels \" ) . \nthat ratio is probably better than what a lot of his peers can boast , but cage has real talent . \nit\'s a shame to waste it in glitzy , superficial tripe like \" gone in 60 seconds . \" \n'
?,'three things i learned from \" being john malkovich \" : when getting on the elevator for your first day of work on the 7 1/2th floor of a building , always bring your crowbar ; don\'t stand in the way of your wife\'s actualization as a man ; and , whenever entering a portal into the mind of another human being , wear old clothes , because , hey , it\'s muddy in there . \n \" being john malkovich \" is the most original film to come down the pike in a very long time . \nwildly surrealistic , yet presented in a down-to-earth , funky style , this is the kind of movie that sticks in your head . \nafter savoring the sheer inventiveness of the storyline , you roll around the wealth of ideas contained within it . \nfrom the ethics of relationships and politics of immortality to the very nature of identity itself , there\'s a lot to think about here . \njust don\'t forget to have fun . \nclearly , all parties involved in the making of the film certainly did , starting with writer charles kaufman . \n \" i wrote \'being john malkovich\' without an outline , \" he explains in the press notes , \" blindly , with no sense of direction or purpose . \nit\'s important to me that i don\'t have a map before i start . \nthis allows me to surprise myself , stay engaged , discover things , and , hopefully , allow the unconscious to surface . \" \nspike jonze ( mark wahlberg\'s na ? ve buddy in \" three kings \" ) takes it from there . \nthe white-hot director of the beastie boy\'s \" sabotage , \" an award-winning parody of \'70s tv cop shows , as well as numerous other music videos and commercials , eschews typical mtv flash for his feature film debut . \njonze wisely realized that a storyline this unusual is most effectively presented in a low-key style . \nhis flat , matter-of-fact approach works perfectly . \nand then there\'s the cast . \njohn cusack plays control freak craig schwartz , a street performer who periodically gets decked by parents objecting to his remarkably expressive , but decidedly erotic puppet shows . \nover the years , his marriage to obsessive pet store employee lotte ( cameron diaz ) has devolved . \nonce passionate lovers , the two are now little more than courteous roommates . \nfinancially strapped , craig takes a job as an entry-level file clerk at lestercorp , located on the 7 1/2th floor of a manhattan building . \nnavigating around dr . lester ( orson bean ) , his 105 year-old boss and floris ( mary kay place ) , lester\'s dotty secretary , craig tries to settle into his new position , but two things keep him distracted . \nfirst , there\'s the beautiful and imperious maxine ( catherine keener ) , who delights in tormenting craig over his obvious lust for her . \nand then there\'s the hole behind the file cabinet , which turns out to be a portal into the mind of actor john malkovich . \ncraig learns that anyone who enters the portal gets whooshed into the subconscious of malkovich , where they can experience life from his point of view ( with enough concentration , you can even influence his actions ) . \nafter 15 minutes , the visitor gets ejected and unceremoniously dumped in a ditch on the side of the new jersey turnpike . \nthen things get a little weird . \nby the way , if you\'re concerned that i gave away too much of the plot , rest assured - - i barely scratched the surface . \none of the most satisfying aspects of the fable is that kaufman is not content to simply milk laughs from his bizarre set-up . \ninstead , he crawls into the dark premise as completely as craig crawls into malkovich , rummaging around and toying with the various philosophical implications of compromising another person\'s identity . \nhe also examines the consequences of the malko-visits to craig , lotte , maxine and , of course , john malkovich himself . \nthe performances are superb . \nmalkovich ( best known to mainstream audiences for his work in \" dangerous liaisons , \" \" in the line of fire , \" and as head psychopath in the guilty-pleasure \" con air \" ) tweaks his own image in a dandy self-deprecating turn . \nfar from his effete , vaguely reptilian persona , this malkovich is just another schlub , drinking with his pals and trying to get laid ( incidentally , charlie sheen also plays himself in a hilarious parody of his well-earned bad boy reputation ) . \nas always , john cusack nails his part , handily pulling viewers along even as craig\'s actions become unconscionable . \nthe big surprises come from catherine keener and cameron diaz , both playing against type . \nkenner , usually cast in icy subordinate roles , is terrific as a highly intelligent , extremely manipulative femme fatale . \ncameron diaz , barely recognizable under a mess of brown , curly hair , sheds her perpetually sunny smile and draws big laughs as a woman thrown into extreme sexual confusion after taking a ride in malkovich . \n \" being john malkovich \" stumbles towards the end , as jonze and kaufman try too hard to resolve the various subplots . \nadditional characters and increasingly complex explanations lead to a cluttered finale . \nregardless , this contemporary \" alice in wonderland \" is a real treat . \ni enjoyed watching \" being john malkovich , \" but only later , after reflecting on the film , did its resonance fully hit me . \nat one point , craig says , \" do you know what a metaphysical can of worms this portal is ?

?,'bad . bad . \nbad . \nthat one word seems to pretty much sums up beyond the valley of the dolls . \nif that summary isn\'t enough for you , how about t&a , t&a , t&a ? \nstill haven\'t got the point ? \nother than director russ meyer\'s predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore-mentioned anatomical areas , there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie . \nthat is the fact that it was co-written by famed film critic roger ebert , who also was responsible for the screenplay . \nafter watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face . \nthis movie stinks out loud . \nquite frankly , this movie deserves a . \nbut there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny . \nso i\'m giving it a . \nand maybe that is too generous . \nright from the opening credits , i knew that i had a class-a bomb on my hands . \nnot only are the way the credits actually shot distracting , but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform . \ni had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening ( it does get explained later ) and as soon as the first scene is over , we cut to a completely unrelated scene . \nto be honest , as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was , i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film . \nwith the quality of the writing during the rest of the film , it wouldn\'t have surprised me if the opening had never been explained . \nso what is this movie about ? \nyou ask . \nlike it really matters . \nok , here goes . \nthis all-girl band headed by kelly macnamara ( dolly reed ) and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry . \nonce there , they do manage to find success ( due as much to their hooters as anything else ? it sure wasn\'t for their brutally bad singing voices ) , and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them . \neverything from big egos , to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral . \nthere are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure , but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing . \n>from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here . \nother than the above-mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have . \nthe dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts . \nmr . ebert has generously thrown in helpings of \" hey man \" , \" dig \" and my all time favorite -- \" this is my happening , and it freaks me out \" . \nnow i ask you , with lines like that how can you go wrong ? \nebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue . \nmaybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter . \ni don\'t know , but all the big words in the world wouldn\'t be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting . \nbut the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie . \ni\'ve seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey . \nin fact , there is one scene -- the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes -- during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries . \nadd to the directing and writing the music in this movie . \ni almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken , there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers . \nthen we have the cast . \nfirst lets start david gurian who played harris , the manager of the band . \nthis has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera . \nsadly , his acting doesn\'t come close to making up for his looks . \nif you have been following along up to this point , this shouldn\'t surprise you . \nmeyer\'s stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets . \ndolly reed plays kelly , the leader of the band . \nand no surprise here , she was cast for her cup size , not her talents . \nand yes , she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents . \nsadly , her ass is almost as large as her chest . \nhey , it a sexist movie , so i\'m writing a sexist review . \nthen we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey , one of the other band members . \nthis goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie . \nmeyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all , but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all . \nsure russ , now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows . \non the up side , she does have a fun lesbo scene . \ni sound like i\'m writing a review in a porn magazine . \nbut hey , i\'ll admit it ; the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked . \nand since that was a huge disappointment , i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey . \nthe only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it . \nunless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too . \nand if you are thinking of checking it out for the double d\'s -- you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet . \nthis is a movie that should be avoided at all costs . \nan even better idea might be to require video stores to place a warning on the box of beyond the valley of the dolls -- beware : this movie is extremely hazardous to your common sense . \nproceed with extreme caution . \n'

?,'let me first say that the conditions that i was forced to watch the matrix under were less than ideal . \nso i have tried to be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal . \ni watched the matrix in a theater that is in serious need of upgrades at the best of times . \nunder no circumstances , should it have ever been allowed to show a big budget special effects laden film like the matrix . \nthis theater , owned by the parent company of one of hollywood\'s biggest studios , hasn\'t even graduated into stereo sound yet . \nthe mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of a speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age . \nin other words , the sound sucked . \nas someone used to digital sound in a movie theater , bad sound doesn\'t do anything to add to a film . \ni\'m not even going to go into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together . \nthere , i\'ve had my rant , now on with the regularly scheduled review . \nwhich sadly won\'t include commentary on the film\'s sound which i\'m assuming was spectacular , but i\'m just guessing . \nmy guess on the sound seems like a fairly solid one considering the visual quality of the matrix . \nit is nothing short of stunning visually . \nsadly , the rest of the film , while pretty good , doesn\'t quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on making this film look so darn good . \nthe matrix has at it\'s core a good concept , although it strays into the confusing side more often than i would have liked . \nkeanu reeves plays a computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality is just a hoax . \nit turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated by some sort of disaster . \nnow machines run the planet and humans spend their lives in a sort of incubator , plugged into a computer network . \nthe computers are generating a virtual reality world which is a representation of the earth before it was destroyed . \nthe population of the planet never realizes that their entire life is a hoax and that they really spend their entire lives as comatose . \nthat is except a small band who have discovered this horrible secret and have escaped their virtual prisons . \nthey now spend their lives combating the computers in an effort to expose this lie . \nreeve\'s character , neo , is recruited by this band of rebels led by morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) . \nnewcomer carrie-anne moss and one of hollywood\'s most underrated actors , joe pantoliano , join fishburne in the band of freedom-fighters . \nthe action sequences are nothing short of spectacular . \nthis can be attributed as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actor\'s extensive pre-production training in martial arts . \nthis lends itself to some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely to see in a film . \nwhen you add this to some of the wild effects in the computer generated world , it all adds up to an eyeful . \nas i already said , the visuals far outpace the rest of the film . \nacting in the matrix is not bad , but it certainly isn\'t real good either . \nkeanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances . \nalthough to his credit , it is one of his better performances . \nlaurence fishburne on the other hand often seemed to forget that he was in a sci-fi action film . \nmore than a few times he delivered his lines as if he thought he was performing in some sort of shakespearean drama . \njoe pantoliano was a little under used in this film but he made the most with what he had . \ncarrie-anne moss turned out a surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role . \nit\'s nice to see that she was cast as much for her talent as for her breathtaking looks . \nyou have to give all of the main actors a healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this film . \nit was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences . \ni also put much of the blame for the somewhat strained performances in the matrix on the dialogue , which was terrible at times . \nin more than a few places it got way too existential for my liking and at other times it was just plain weird . \nit almost seems as though the writers were having a difficult time trying to figure out how to explain the concept for the movie . \nso they decided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so that no one could figure out what the heck they were talking about . \nthereby covering up any leaps of faith that they may have had to make in the departments of logic and believability . \nmy other major complaint with the matrix was with the very unsatisfying ending . \nthe setup for it was hokey and frankly used in many a bad film before . \nthe ending itself was just plain strange . \nthe main reasons to recommend the matrix are the visual effects and computer animation which make this a real treat to watch . \nwhile the rest of the film ( acting , dialogue and to a degree plot ) detract from the high production values , they don\'t detract enough to prevent me from recommending the matrix as a fun way to spend an evening . \n'
?,'another \'independent film\' , this comedy , which was brought by miramax for $5 million , is good fun . \nfavreau and vaughn ( the lost world : jurassic park , 1997 ) play mike and trent , two everyday 20somethings on the lookout for women . \nthe film just basically follows their plight on the lookout for lurve , and along the way we get to meet some of their friends , see their attempts at chatting up girls , and just basically get a insight into their lives . \nand all of this is great fun . \nswingers doesn\'t rely on huge special effects , or big name stars to provide entertainment . \nno , it just has a great script and superb little known actors . \nthe script , by favreau , is great . \nmike is always missing is girlfriend , who hasn\'t called him for six months , and every time he meets a girl , he always end up telling her about the ex . \nthe audience feels for this pathetic little man , thanks to the great script . \nvaughn is \'the money\' ( swingers speak for \'the best\' ) as the womanizing trent , always on the lookout for a new girl . \nsome of his chat-up lines are awful , but he always seems to get the girl thanks to his \'hard man\' nature . \nvaughns character also gets the best laugh in the film , towards the end in a diner . \nthe conversations that go on between mike and trent are great , but it never quite reaches tarantino standards ( which i suspect the film was trying to reach . ) \nthere are some excellent , laugh out loud jokes in the film , and some superbly funny set pieces ( such as favreau cringe-worhy battle with a answer machine that always cut him off before he finishes his sentence . \nembarrassing to him , hilarious to the audience . ) \nmike & trents friends are also good , although there characters seem a bit underwritten , and we never really learn as much as we would like about them . \nalthough this is primarily mike and trents film , it would of been nice to learn a bit more about their friends . \nthey just seem to wander aimlessly in the background . \nbut again , the lines they say are usually pretty good , and they do have some funny parts . \nit\'s just a shame that they didn\'t have more meatier roles . \nthe acting is superb . \nas said above , vaughn is superb as trent , he\'s definitely the best thing in the film . \nfavreau is also good , acting as \'the little man\' very well , and the way he always feels sorry for himself is very funny . \ngraham ( boogie nights , 1997 ) has a small but good role as lorraine , a girl mike finally falls in love with . \nshe hardly features in the film at all , but she still manages to make an impact on the audience . \nswingers , then , is funny , but it does have some flaws . \nfirstly , the running time is a bit too short . \nthe film comes to an abrupt halt , and i actually wanted the film to carry on longer . \nit never really comes to a satisfying conclusion , which is a shame , as most films are too long ! \nalso , this type of film has been done too many times , such as sleep with me ( 1994 ) . \nbut these small flaws don\'t really spoil what is a funny , entertaining comedy . \n'
?,'i think of i know what you did last summer as the movie that scream and scream 2 could have been . \nmind you , though , i mean this in the worst possible way . \ni know what you did last summer is a typical slasher flic without the smarts of the scream\'s . \nas a result , it\'s even worse than some of your better campy horror pictures ( see nightmare on elm street ) because it thinks it\'s about thirty times smarter than it is . \nbased on a teen book of the same name and , disappointingly , adapted by scream scribe kevin williamson , i know what you did last summer begins with appropriately angsty modern rock music combined with some startling cinematography of a cliff along the ocean and an angsty sort sitting at the top . \nthe appropriate mood being set ( this is angst-horror for the 90\'s ) , we cut over to the july 4th parade in a small north carolina town . \nfrom there , we see the blond , female protagonist , helen shivers ( woodenly played by sarah michelle geller ) , getting crowned croaker queen as the blond male \" hero , \" barry cox ( woodenly played by ryan phillipe ) , and matched brunette pair of protagonists , julie james and ray bronson ( woodenly played by party of five\'s jennifer love hewitt and freddie prinze jr . , respectively ) cheer her on . \nafter getting drunk at a party , going to a beach to wittily discuss urban legend and indulge in some foreshadowing , and having some meaningful sex ( if you believe what the characters say ) , the four run down some guy crossing the windy cliff road at night . \nhis face is mangled so they can\'t tell who it is , and they come to the decision to dump him in the ocean so as to not ruin any of their future chances for success in the world . \ncut to one year later . \nthe lives of our protagonists have gone from annoying to bad . \nmain brunette female , the bright one of the bunch , has been plagued with guilt and almost failed out of college . \nblond female has forfeited her dreams of starring on guiding light , and now works at the family store in town . \nbrunette male is a fisherman , living off the land . \nblond male has become a complete jerk and quarterback on some college football team . \nthen , predictably , their past comes back to haunt them . \nit all begins with an irrational murder , followed by some taunting of protagonists by the mysterious killer , bad acting by a good actress ( anne heche ) , an improbable plot , bad acting by the main bad actors , some more killing , concluding in a climactic scene , mostly climactic in the relief at the end of the movie . \nall the while , the actors and actresses spout off bad lines , and main brunette male does his best keanu reeves imitation . \nnot that the movie was without pleasure . \ncount the illogical plot twists and bad lines for some fun . \nmostly , though , note the costumes of main females and how trendily unattractive they make the otherwise eye-catching pair look . \n'
?,'one of the 90s\' most unwelcome thriller trends returns from the grave : it\'s the \" ___ from hell \" movie ! \nstarting in the early nineties , we were subjected to nearly every conceivable combination of relationships-from-hell ! \nthere were boyfriends from hell , friendly neighborhood cops from hell , nannies from hell , and even secretaries from hell . \nbut hush has found an old standby that somehow was forgotten in the rush : the mother-in-law from hell ! ! ! ! ! \nthe mother-in-law in question is martha , played by jessica lange . \nshe has been single-handedly running the family horse farm , kilronan . \nher son , jackson ( johnathon schaech ) and his girlfriend , helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , live in new york , and have no intention to move back down south to the rural kilronan . \nbut those intentions are about to change . \nyou see , martha lives by manipulation . \nshe has used it in years past to breed many championship horses . \nnow , she believes she can use it to breed herself a grandson . \nthough at first , helen finds martha charming , soon she is caught in the domineering martha\'s web of deception . \nit\'s hard to understand why nobody ever wises up to martha\' schemes . \nas written , most of the characters in the film must be very slow witted . \nbut then , the film even treats the audience like idiots . \nit tries to get away with things ( like leaving a critical piece of evidence in a rather unlikely place ) without even batting an eye . \nthen again an audience which accepts characters as shallow as these isn\'t one that\'s likely to question details . \njessica lange\'s martha is the only semi-developed character in the film , and she applies her talents to redeem it as much as she can . \na character that could have been simply awful is merely groan-worthy . \ngwyneth paltrow doesn\'t have much to build upon , as helen\'s only character trait seems to be \" daughter-in-law \" . \nstill , she fares better than johnathon schaech , whose character is so nonexistent , he\'s inexplicably missing for much of the film . \nstill , there have been much worse \" ____ from hell \" films . \neven with its paper-thin characters and ludicrous setups , hush manages to create a few thrills in a color-by-numbers fashion . \nyou know what\'s coming , but occasionally the film will deliver a shock or two . \nthe old formulas are around for a reason , but that doesn\'t mean they taste fresh . \n'
?,'i can imagine how good krippendorf\'s tribe must have looked on paper . \nit does not surprise me in the least that a group of extremely talented actors , led by the great richard dreyfuss and a good director ( todd holland ) , all wanted to make this film . \nin fact , it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorf\'s tribe as possible . \nin retrospect , i can imagine how bad this film could have been . \ni shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss . \ndreyfuss plays james krippendorf , an anthropologist who is granted $100 , 000 by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea . \nhalfway into his two-year expedition , his wife ( apparently ) dies . \ni say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established . \nlater , we find out that much of the grant money was spent on big-screen tvs and other such pleasures . \nso , when krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do not use their grant money wisely , he decides to construct an elaborate lie . \nhe makes his own tribe , using his three children as actors in a video . \nhe simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe ( which he calls the shelmickedmu ) . \naudiences at krippendorf\'s lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision . \nand proof that the typical family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community . \nlike all films like this , the lie becomes more and more complex , and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it is all going to fall out from under our hero . \ndreyfuss is a funny , talented man , and he is funny in this film . \nhe has lots of positive energy and , unlike most comical actors , really manages to play people like this realistically . \nthis film also requires a lot of physical humor that i\'ve never seen dreyfuss perform , and he does a great job . \njenna elfman , who plays veronica mecilli , a scientist who wants in on krippendorf\'s work , is also very funny and appealing here . \nand the kid actors are great , as well . \nbut we\'re talking about the script from hell . \nthis is one of those stories that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things like this can happen . \nbut the ridiculousness of the story is not really what is so bad about it . \nall the cliches and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss and crew . \nno , the script is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes and mean-spirited characters that i was in disbelief as i watched . \nfurthermore , the manor in which all of this material is covered up is truly shameless . \ntake , for instance , the scene in which krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them having sex . \nthey get all decked out in the tribe getup , complete with paint to darken their skin . \nkrippendorf does this because he needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe . \nnow , i saw this scene coming from a mile away , but i said to myself , \" no , that would be far too tasteless . \nthere\'s no way they\'ll do that . . . oh \ngod ! \" \nthey did do it . \nit\'s there . \ni was almost more appalled by the fact that this didn\'t bother the other audience members with whom i saw this film . \ni found it deplorable . \nand when krippendorf is forced to admit that he did it , he simply apologizes without the slightest hint of conviction in his voice . \nthe film is filled with scenes like these . \nthey not only insult the audience , but they insult the types of people that the film portrays . \nit would take some truly professional work to create videos convincing enough to fool an entire community of scientists , yet krippendorf does it easily in an afternoon . \nand watching dreyfuss stumble over a completely unprepared speech is funny and entertaining , but i think that most members of the on-screen audience would be able to see that he is making everything up as he goes . \nif i were an anthropologist , this film would insult me immensely . \nmoving right along , the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes . \nsure , dreyfuss dressing up like a chief is really funny , and it allows for some entertaining scenes , but the heart of this material is deeply clueless as to the themes and thoughts that it provokes . \nit is because of dreyfuss as an actor that i was able to watch this film . \nhis character here is not a good subject for a film because he is a shameless liar , and never once does he show any kind of penance for what he does . \ni suppose it was interesting to see the formula defied in this case , but for the purposes of good taste , i would have expected something . \nno , this man sets a terrible example for his kids and colleagues , and the writer of the film ( charlie peters ) didn\'t include a single scene in which krippendorf takes his kids aside and tells them that what he is doing is very bad . \nin fact , it\'s his eldest daughter that frequently tells him that he is doing the wrong thing , and he continually shrugs off her warnings . \ni suppose it\'s important to admit that this is a funny film . \ndreyfuss and elfman , and many of the contrived and insulting scenes , add up to a picture that is anything but boring . \nand if you\'re less serious than i , you probably will enjoy it . \ni , however , can\'t get past these elements . \nkrippendorf\'s tribe is being marketed as a family comedy , but this is the kind of film that teaches the kids of our society faulty lessons that they shouldn\'t be learning . \nwith a little more insight into its story and themes , this could have been a good movie . \n'
?,'in \" the sweet hereafter , \" writer/director atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living . \nhe shows us how it isn\'t dying that hurts , but rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death , and dealing with the loss and grief that it brings . \non a cold winter day in a small , isolated town in british columbia , a school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto a frozen lake , where it cracks through the ice and sinks . \nfourteen children die , and numerous others are hurt . \nfor the residents of this small town , all of whose children were on that bus , it is an earth-shattering event that resolutely alters their lives . \nthey have always relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache and pain , but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle . \nalberta and risa walker , who own a local motel and lost their child in the accident , hire an attorney named mitchell stephens ( ian holm ) to bring a lawsuit against someone , anyone for responsibility . \nthe bus driver , dolores driscoll ( gabrielle rose ) , is a kindly woman who loved the children and , although she lives with a burden of guilt , is not held responsible for the accident . \nthe bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice , and there was nothing should could do to prevent it . \nhowever , according to stephens , there are no \" accidents \" in life , and someone will pay for this tragedy , whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through . \nhe goes through the town , approaching the parents who have lost children , asking them to join the class action suit and find vent for their anger . \nand , for his work , stephens will receive one-third of the settlement money . \nhowever , it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money . \nhe is driven by something else , something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents . \nhe has lost a child , too , but not in the same manner . \nhis daughter , zoe ( caerthan banks ) , who once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite , has been in and out of drug re-hab clinics and detox stations for ten years . \nshe calls him on an irregular basis , begging him for money , but refusing to tell him what she needs it for . \n \" i don\'t know who i\'m taking to , \" he tells her . \nin his mind , his daughter is dead . \nthe lawsuit is , to stephens , not only a way to mend the town\'s pain , but also his own . \nhowever , not everyone in town wants it to happen . \nbilly ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who was driving behind the bus when the accident happened and lost two children , wants nothing to do with it . \nhe has already lost his wife , and he buries his grief in an affair with a married woman . \nhe doesn\'t want to talk about the accident , and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds . \nto him , the town should be able to take care of its own pain , and it doesn\'t need outsiders like stephens getting in the way . \ncentral to \" the sweet hereafter \" is the tale of nicole burnell ( sarah polley ) , a teenage girl who dreams of being a singer before the accident turned her into \" a wheelchair girl , \" as she puts it . \naside from stephens , nicole is the most complex character in the film , and it is she who ultimately decides the fate of the town and how the lawsuit will turn out . \nit is also her sad , haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack , reading robert browning\'s poem about the pied piper , and how when he led all the town\'s children away , one was left behind because he was crippled . \nobviously , nicole is that child , and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the town\'s children left her alone by dying in the wreck . \nher situation is further complicated because she is involved in a loving , but incestuous relationship with her father ( tom mccamus ) . \nthere is only one , fleeting scene that suggests this relationship , but it is somehow tied into the final act of the film . \nof all the storylines in \" the sweet hereafter , \" this is the most complicated and unresolved , although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film . \negoyan knows that the kinds of questions he brings up have no simple answers -- if any at all -- and he doesn\'t condescend to the audience by trying to neatly wrap it up . \nwhat egoyan has done in \" the sweet hereafter \" is really nothing short of miraculous . \nin his adaptation of the novel by russell banks , he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law and driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss , and how pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared to human life . \negoyan has always been a talented , but distant and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold . \n \" the sweet hereafter \" is quite the opposite ; egoyan\'s stylistic and narrative structures work brilliantly to heighten the impact of the natural emotion , and draw the audience into the tragedy . \n \" the sweet hereafter \" seems to contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked . \nthe film is filled with beautiful , subtle performances from all the actors , especially ian holm as the lawyer and sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind . \nthe beautiful , roving camerawork by paul sarossy and the haunting , melodic musical score by mychael danna ( both previous egoyan collaborators ) give the film a visual and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements . \nlike his earlier films , egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form a blanketing whole . \nhe works with time as a fluid substance , shifting back and forth between the past , the distant past , and the present with effortless ease . \nthe actual bus wreck itself doesn\'t happen until midway through the film , but by that time the event has built up so much emotion that egoyan can film it from a distance with no graphic detail , and still have it carry great , devastating weight . \nbecause human life has become such a cheap commodity in movies , it is astounding that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple , direct terms . \ncertainly one of the best films of 1997 , \" the sweet hereafter \" is a deeply rewarding , mystifying , and ultimately human film . \n'
?,'some movies ask you to leave your brain at the door , some movies ask you to believe in the impossible to really have a good time . \nplaying god asks just one simple , eensy , teensy thing so it can fully entertain you , it\'s accomplished in just four easy to follow steps : crack open your skull , scoop out your brain , squish it under your foot several times and reverse steps two and one . \ncongratulations , you now have all the necessary requirements to fully enjoy a whole lot of nothing . \nsome movies fail at the box office but you manage to see why the producers thought it could have been a good movie , others are simply good ideas that are badly executed . \nthen there\'s playing god , which enters the esteemed category of movies which seem to have grown from the union of a drunk director , actors satisfied in the knowledge that this horrible flick will have no lasting impact on their careers and a bunch of rip-offs ( or homages as they like to call it ) from other , better movies that end up looking like an unflushed toilet . \nharsh ? maybe . \njustified ? \nhell yes ! \nthis is a movie that is not just satisfied in ripping off other movies but feels the need to remind us of that fact every ten minutes . \nfor example , a gunman bursts into a garden with the two guns in his hands firing away . \nthis does look moderately kool , but the camera lingers on the actor for so long you can almost hear the director yelling : \" oooh , look look ! \njohn woo ! \ntwo guns blazing ! \nslooooow motion ! \" \nand if that wasn\'t enough , you can also hear the script grunting under the effort it must take to try and make every single line of dialogue sound like something deep and meaningful like in a tarantino movie . \npoor timothy hutton gets to deliver most of the corny lines , you have to admire the effort he puts into it , this guy deserves better . \nunlike most movies this one does not suffer from \" stupid bad guy \" syndrome , just to make things a little different this time we get stupid heroes . \nexample : duchovny manages to distract a bad guy by making him go into the bathroom to get some bandages . \nnow the bad guy is , like , stoned , man , so he leaves his shotgun next to our hero . \n ( term used as loosely as possible ) \nsurvival instincts and a good dose of common sense seems to suggest grabbing the shotgun , which our hero does , but only after contemplating it for about thirty seconds . \neven when he does grab it he seems unsure how to hold it , going so far as to actually wonder if he should place a finger near the trigger . \nmind you , i\'ve never fired a shotgun in my life but believe you me that the bad guy would be missing most of his vital organs , be he stoned or not . \nsome will argue that our hero does not have a killer instinct , the hell with that ! \ntwo fbi guys have just been shot in front me , along with one bad guy and the other looks like he might go ballistic at any second . \nsolution ? \nboom ! \ni\'ll take the time to feel sorry about it later thank you very much . \nanother prime example of the idiot hero syndrome : \nour boy duchovny needs to reach his girl before something bad happens to her . \nhe knows the head bad guy has her on the tenth floor of a building and that he might be running into a room full of people with itchy trigger fingers . \nhe still has his shotgun , bring it along you say ? \nno thanks , i\'ll just ditch it in the back of my car . \nand the real kicker is this : when he reaches the room and people start shooting at him he has the nerve to look surprised ! \nwhile we are on the subject of getting shot , why in hades were those fbi guys sitting with their backs to the door ? \ni\'ve got no formal training but even i know you never sit with your back to the door . \nask mr . wild bill , the first and only time he did not sit with his back to a wall cost him his life . \nthis is the major problem with this movie , any mook could have thought of a hundred ways to make it better . \nis it so much to ask that hollywood actually put a little common sense into their characters ? \nfor instance : \nour heroes hide at duchovny\'s summer home , now the bad guys could come knocking at any moment . \nok , this time our hero does get himself a gun and has it at his side most of the time . \nbut see , our hero is a drug addict and guess what ? \nhe chooses now to go clean and suffer through dt . \noh sure , he\'ll be really impressive when the bad guys come calling . \ngoing clean is really honorable of him , but i would have waited until i did not need to be conscious or being able to fire a gun . \nfor an enjoyable performance by timothy hutton , plot holes the size of godzilla , getting our intelligence insulted and several \" oh come on ! \" \nmoments . \n'
?,'bob the happy bastard\'s quickie review : \ni must admit , no doubt\'s single \" new \" is quite catchy . \nit was bouncy and energetic enough to get me to go see this new film from director doug limon , the man who had brought us the humorous swingers a little while back . \nthe result ? \na movie that\'s just as good as that song , really . \nit follows the lives of several individuals over the course of one weekend . \nfirst we hear about a grocery bagger ( sara polley ) who runs into a monetary situation problem and ends up selling bogus drugs at a rave ( with bad results , as a drug dealer feels he\'s been swindled by her ) ; then comes the story of an english grocery store worker ( same store ) who heads to vegas for the weekend with friends , where sex , gunplay , and stolen car trouble come into play ; then we see the story of two gay movie actors ( played by scott wolf and jay mohr ) who deal with a cop\'s strange insurance presentation and hitting a girl ( sara ) with their car ; and , finally , we come to another grocery worker ( katie holmes ) who has a strange fascination with said drug dealer ( the one mentioned earlier ) . \nreally , it\'s all confusing to keep track of in review format , your best bet is to just , well , go . \nthe movie features some very good acting from all angles , and limon adds the same humorous energy he had with swingers to this particular product . \nthe dialogue is pretty snappy and the resolution is pretty well realized , not going for the sappy happy ending nor the dreaded bad ending . \nthink of it as a , well , ending . \nthe intertwining of stories is a particularly good element to the movie , as it\'s never really confusing and tells different sides of the story , like sliding doors kinda did . \nhowever , it\'s better suited for the younger generation who want a little spice in their flicks , which sliding doors kinda isn\'t . \n'
?,'girl 6 is , in a word , a mess . \ni was never able to determine what spike lee was trying to accomplish with this film . \nthere was no sense of where the film was going , or any kind of coherent narrative . \nif there was a point to the film , i missed it . \ngirl 6 , by the way , is the way theresa randle\'s character is addressed in the phone sex workplace ; all the girls are known by their numbers . \nthe plot , such as it is : theresa randle is a struggling n . y . actress , and eventually takes a job as a phone-sex operator . \nshe begins to lose contact with reality , as her job consumes her . \nalso , she must deal with the advances of her ex-husband ( isiah washington ) . \nhe is an ex- con thief , and she tries to keep him away , while at the same time , it\'s clear that she still harbors feelings for him . \nher neighbor , jimmy ( spike lee ) functions as the observer ; mediating between the ex- husband and girl 6 . \nhe also functions as a point of stability , as he watches her become seduced by the lurid world of phone sex . \nthe soundtrack , consisting of songs by prince , was jarring . \nit kept taking my attention from the film - not altogether a bad thing , i\'ll grant you , as what was transpiring onscreen wasn\'t that riveting . \nfor parts of the middle of the film , the music stayed blissfully in the background . \nin the opening sequence and one scene later in the film , however , the music was particularly loud and distracting . \nof course , i\'ve never really cared for prince\'s ( or tafkap if you like ) music . \nprince fans might love the soundtrack , but it will probably be distracting , even to die-hard fans . \nof the performances , the only one that stood out was spike lee\'s buddy character , jimmy . \nhe was excellent as the always-broke neighbor of girl 6 . \nhe should have stuck to acting in this film . \nthere are several sequences that gave me the impression that he\'d like to be oliver stone when he grows up . \nthere are scenes shot with different types of film , which are purposely grainy , and reminiscent of some of the scenes in oliver stone\'s natural born killers . \nin that film , they worked to propel the narrative . \nin this film , they just made me more confused . \nthere are some amusing moments , and a few insights into the lives of the women who use their voices to make the phone-sex industry the multi-billion dollar industry that it has become . \nother than that , though , nothing much happens . \nthere are a few intense moments , as when one caller becomes frightening , but even that is rather lackluster . \ni\'m not the biggest fan of spike lee , though i\'d agree that he has done some very good work in the past . \nin girl 6 , though , he seems to be floundering . \nhe had an interesting idea , a fairly good setup , and seemed to wander aimlessly from there . \ngirl 6 earns a grade of d . \n'
?,'playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task : they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare\'s works . \nthey also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare : i mean , really , who doesn\'t think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate , introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter ? \nstoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare , and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare . \nand , despite the difficulty of their task , they have succeeded . \nshakespeare in love is one of the smartest , funniest , most touching films of the year . \nit\'s so rare that a picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors , but here we have a movie that defines success : it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written . \nit could have been a smug , self-important movie that panders to die-hard shakespeare fans , but the appeal of this film is almost universal : if you\'ve ever read a play by shakespeare , or know anything about his life , it\'s likely that you\'ll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love . \njoseph fiennes , brother of ralph , stars as shakespeare himself ; he\'s a delightful , irresistible lad , concerned mostly with women and detached from life\'s more serious problems ( debt , plague , etc . ) . \nhe\'s commissioned to write plays for various people : queen elizabeth ( judi dench ) wants comedies , while local slimeball philip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann ( tom wilkinson ) . \nshakespeare , however , has trouble focusing on his work . \nhe begins work on a comedy about a boy named romeo and a girl named ethel . \nthis all changes , however , when he meets viola de lesseps ( a radiant gwyneth paltrow ) , a young heiress set to marry the financially-oriented lord wessex ( colin firth ) . \nshakespeare instantly falls in love with her ; he first meets her when she pretends to be a man to try out for the part of romeo . \nhe discovers her identity and confronts her later ; she , of course , falls in love with him , although their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex . \nbut she continues to act because she loves shakespeare\'s writing so much , and soon the production ( which later becomes romeo and juliet ) is set to be performed . \nshakespeare in love is an amazingly good film , not because it works as great entertainment , but because it pays attention to detail and knows its subject matter . \ni was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role : he has such searing optimism and energy ; he\'s clearly a man who admires shakespeare , and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character ( inability to turn away from women , attention deficit disorder ) , we sense a great deal of affection and care . \nhe practically overflows with passion in every scene . \nfiennes is matched by paltrow ( whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from ) ; she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every performance i\'ve seen her in . \nthe two performers work perfectly together , taking the passionate scenes as far as possible without making them melodramatic , and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh . \nof course , it doesn\'t hurt that they have a masterful script to work with . \nstoppard , whose play rozencrantz and guildenstern are dead inspired an interesting film , is full of dry wit and boundless understated humor ( all of his plays have similarly dry humor ) . \nthe first intelligent step stoppard and norman took was harmonizing the events of the film with romeo and juliet . \none of the funniest scenes in the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play ; in the movie , shakespeare is bumbling about while viola is trying to fend off her nurse maid . \ndirector john madden does a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor -- scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the hands of a lesser director . \ni\'m going to have to see the movie again ; i\'m certain there are numerous references that i missed . \nin fact , i doubt it\'s possible to gather everything with just one viewing . \nstoppard is a master of detail : you\'ll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film , not as lines of a play , but as dialogue , suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time . \nthere\'s also a brilliant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant competition with christopher marlowe ( and the fact that marlowe is played by the openly-homosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself ) , proposing a slightly twisted explanation to marlowe\'s mysterious death in a pub . \nthere\'s also a scene featuring a wide-eyed dog that is so funny that i hurt myself laughing . \n \" there\'s no dog in this play ? \" \n \" no ! \nno dog ! \" \nthe ensemble cast is perhaps the strongest this year . \ngeoffrey rush is nearly unrecognizable as the detestable henslowe ; wilkinson is also hard to recognize , but has a great role as a thug who takes his part as the apothecary so seriously . \nben affleck , playing one of the actors in the company , shows great range , both in his accent ( his is almost as good as paltrow\'s ) and in humor ( he has some of the best one-liners in the movie ) . \ncolin firth , always stuck playing the sap , does a good job being hateful . \njudi dench , however , has the best supporting performance as queen elizabeth : rarely has so much depth been conveyed in so few words . \nmy single , minor complaint about shakespeare in love is that i feel like i could have been more moved by the end . \nthe story is moving , but there are a few missed opportunities in the final scenes . \nbut my quibbling is not important . \nwhat is important is that i acknowledge the quality of this picture , the sheer skill with which it has been written , acted , and produced . \nshakespeare in love tries so many things , and nails every one of them : it\'s a film that both loves shakespeare and makes fun of him , a film in which the actors , writers , and director are all perfectly in sync . \nit\'s also a movie that has the potential to introduce a lot of people to shakespeare\'s work in a positive way , without seeming condescending or superior . \ni admire this film not only because it passes so pleasantly , but because it has lofty aspirations and succeeds in them . \nnot just any film can poke fun at shakespeare and get away with it . \n'
?,'back in 1980s , chuck norris used to be synonym for the action films . \nhe couldn\'t , of course , top the success and fame of big action names like sylvester stallone or arnold schwarzenegger , but sheer quantity of his films guaranteed that he was household name among shoot\'em up and beat\'em up genre aficionados . \nthat quantity was mostly provided by cannon group , prolific production company that dominated the b-movie market in previous decade by flooding it with cheap , formulaic and , more often than not , unwatchable genre products . \nthe hitman , 1991 action thriller directed by chuck\'s brother aaron , is one of the last among them . \nchuck norris here plays seattle cop betrayed , shot and left for dead by his partner ( which shouldn\'t surprise anyone , considering the fact that the partner is being played by michael parks , specialised for roles of usually very mean characters ) . \nsurviving the shooting , cop is pronounced dead and hired as deep undercover agent . \nhe infiltrates the underworld circles in seattle and becomes their top hitman , using his abilities to start brutal war between three major crime organisations - italians , french canadians and iranians . \nsince it is rather absurd to expect great acting ability from chuck norris , at least not in this kind of movie , the biggest attraction of this film should have been action . \nwell , the action in this film falls flat - it is boring , repetitive and not at all exciting . \nit is nothing more than monotonous series of scenes that contains violence too brutal even for this type of films . \nwe know very little about norris\' character while , on the other hand , gangsters are portrayed with more human dimension . \nin the end we almost feel sorry for them , since they are shown totally powerless against norris and his unstoppable and bloody crusade . \nduring the film , somebody obviously became aware of that problem , so the screenwriter introduced the subplot dealing with the black boy who gets adopted by norris . \nthat caused another problem - any questions about nature of that relationship had to be quashed with another subplot - this one dealing with lady lawyer who sleeps with the hero and gets killed after fulfilling that screenplay obligation . \nthe photography in this film is dark , setting is depressive and this forgettable piece of 1980s style cinema leaves viewers without any reason to justify the hour and half spent in watching it . \n'
?,'the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and \" real \" movies . \nconsider for a moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved -- lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste . \ntop-flight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety . \nbased on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks , the movie represents a rethinking of the story\'s structure , not merely a literal adaptation of the novel . \ntold in linear form by four narrators in the book , egoyan\'s version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without a narrator . \nthe author is even on record as applauding egoyan\'s changes . \nin the press notes the book\'s author describes the story as \" a parable of lost children . \" \nhe says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children . \npicking up on this , egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter , nicole burnell , played with grace by sarah polley , reads parts of \" the pied piper \" from an old , illustrated book to her two charges . \nperiodically throughout the picture , nicole\'s readings are heard in voice-over . \nyou have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment . \nthey and the rest of the town\'s children come into harm\'s way -- some live and others are seriously injured . \nand the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again . \nalthough the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children , the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss . \nian holm , in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career , plays mitchell stephens , an intense man of quiet misery . \nmitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small , snow-encrusted community in the british columbian wilderness . \nhis mission there is a singular one , to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone , anyone , on their behalf . \nif this seems crass , well it is , but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot . \nthe story unfolds slowly and always believably . \neach little aspect has its own fascination . \nas mitchell interviews wendell and rita walker , played with quiet realism by maury chaykin and alberta watson , he has a simple task . \nhe wants them to suggest some model couple in the village who has a lost a child so that he can use that couple to form the basis of the suit . \nwendell ticks off one town member after another and then , as one can in a small town , enumerates each person\'s numerous faults . \nalthough the town is no peyton place , people there do have their foibles . \none of the best parents in the town appears to be billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who rides his pickup behind the school bus everyday just so he can wave good-bye to his kids . \nwell , single parent billy\'s fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts with the married rita . \nhis confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story . \nthe accident itself , a simple one of a bus hitting a patch of ice , isn\'t shown until the middle of the picture , but , nevertheless , the mystery about it builds throughout the film . \nalthough the picture is no detective story , finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in a movie that is primarily a character study of a town gripped by tragedy . \nas the injured bus driver , gabrielle rose , dolores driscoll plays the role of a dedicated individual who loves kids with a passion and for whom the tragedy takes on special meaning . \nto round out the story , mitchell has his own private tragedy to bear . \nhis daughter zoe ( caerthan banks ) is a drug addict who has bounced in and out of one half-way house and recovery center after another . \nfond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for money or help , she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments as he attempts to sign up the townsfolk . \n ( \" i can help you , \" mitchell tries to reassure billy . \n \" not unless you can raise the dead , \" billy snaps back . \nmitchell\'s pitch is never an easy one and worrying about zoe only makes it harder . ) \nmychael danna\'s haunting music sets the stage for tragedy . \nthe cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor grandeur , but it is in the warm , shadowy , intimate moments indoors where it works best . \nthe show , which is ripe for emotional manipulation , never plays with its audience . \nstill , when the house lights go up , you may feel as i did . \ni could barely breathe ; i was so overcome by the sum total of what i had witnessed . \nmore than anything , the film is like a master painting . \neach cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty building with each dollop of paint . \nwith the final color in place , the masterpiece is complete , and the ending credits roll . \nthe sweet hereafter runs 1 : 50 . \nit is rated r for mature themes , sexuality and some profanity and would be fine teenagers . \n'

?,'this well-conceived but ultra sugary coming-of-age film is not for everyone , and i include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion . \njoseph cross ( joshua beal ) is a 10-year-old who is saddened by the recent loss of his grandfather ( loggia ) to bone marrow cancer . \nloggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such a wholesome manner , it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup . \nthe beals are like a sitcom idyllic family , where everyone is just so nice and affluent , and properly religious without being fanatical . \nthe beals , the father ( denis leary ) and his wife ( dana delany ) , are both successful doctors ; julia stiles plays joshua\'s older sister , needling her younger brother but also showing that she really cares about him . \nthis is a family seemingly conceived in heaven , but living in south philadelphia , sending their children to a well-run catholic school . \njoshua , the protagonist and the narrator of this yarn , is a handsome , sweet , intelligent , friendly , and endearing child , who does well in school , relates to the nuns and priests , and talks politely to his well-meaning parents . \nall this mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch . \nthe plot arises when joseph has a problem coping with the death of his beloved grandfather , who promised to be with him forever . \nhis answer is to search for god , pretty heady stuff for a youngster his age to do , but that\'s just the way it is , sometimes . \nthis search for god takes us nowhere because , as his friend david ( reifsnyder ) says , where can you look for him if he doesn\'t exist . \nnow , that\'s a smart kid . \nbut joseph looks for him in the usual places , and what better place than to start in the parochial school he attends . \none of his teachers is the kind-hearted sister terry ( rosie o\'donnell ) , who wears a philly baseball hat and equates the jesus stories with baseball , making him the clean-up hitter , and in my opinion , if she wasn\'t a big tv star , would have a vocation as a parochial school teacher , she is that convincing . \nthroughout the film , she is saved from answering any tough ( sic ! ) \nquestion about god by the bell , as it rings to end the class . \nnothing much happens in the search for god , there is no parody of the catholic school ; though a visiting cardinal is found by the boy not to be able to talk to god , but this is gentle stuff , no real criticism or search for god is attempted . \nwhat comes next into play is some hollywood hokum , which is designed not to upset anyone , as joseph has a reassuring encounter with a real , live angel , a blond little boy his own age and dressed like him in the catholic school uniform who wears the innocuous smile of a goody-goody . \nthe film ends as this angel ( ! ! ! ) \ntells him his grandfather is all right . \nhis quest is ended , as apparently angels don\'t have wings and are approachable ; and god , well , . . . \nmaybe that\'s for another film down the road . \nthis part of the film was the final straw for me , i couldn\'t swallow any more goo . \nas this film flopped commercially , his next one , the sixth sense , pared down the schmaltz and came up smelling like a rose . \nthough if you look through the cleverness of both scripts , this director is loaded with hokum , all he has learned how to do , is hide the hokum better . \nwell , god bless him , if he can do that . \nthis is a nice family picture and there is room for it in hollywood . \nit\'s just too bad that it had nothing relevent or even truthful to say about death , children in a parochial elementary school , or for that matter , about god . \nand that family of his , they\'re too good for words . \nyet the film meant well and its benign message had its heart in the right place . \nfor those who want to see something soft , without a bite to it , this is the one . \n'

?,'when a film is produced on a shoestring budget by a couple of hardworking filmmakers and when it tells the story of a genuine tragedy , the easy path for a reviewer who hated the movie is to give it a pass . \ntoss out your usual objectivity , ignore how many times you checked your watch while viewing it , forget how unbearable it was to sit through , and find some meaningless way to compliment it . \nthis , of course , will be of no service to your readers , but at least you\'ll avoid the hate mail from the movie\'s fans . \nthus it is with a heavy heart that i review the movie paulina ( not to be confused with the recent movie paulie about a talking parrot ) . \ndirected by vicky funari as a labor of intense love - she spent the last one third of her life on film - the movie blends documentary footage with historic and fanciful recreations to relate the bitterly sad and true story of paulina cruz suarez . \npaulina was a maid in vicky\'s household when vicky was young . \ni got to learn the film\'s background when i attended a screening in which the two women who made it were present . \nfor those without such context , the reaction to the film may be that it is a parody of a bad indie film . \nthe acting is amateurish , the story is maudlin , and it has all the visual appeal of a bad home movie . \ngrainy and overexposed , the movie , shot on 16mm film and videotape , has little to recommend it . \nconfusingly composed , the movie jumps about jarringly as it tells its story . \nquite bloody at times , the story , full of horrific images , seems designed to shock and repulse us . \nwhy else would you include a scene with a completely nude and bloody 8-year-old paulina ? \nanother scene has a teenage paulina being fondled on a bus by the man sitting next to her . \nin retaliation , she bites off part of his finger . \nthis covers the both of them in a bucket of blood . \nthe passengers on the bus then view the girl in their minds as everything from saint to sinner . \none , for example , sees her as an aztec priestess holding out a large heart that she had just cut from a body . \nthe lugubrious tale has paulina being raped and beaten . \ncertainly she had to endure a miserable life . \nbut that does not guarantee that a movie about her will necessarily being good . \ni felt trapped in the theater watching it . \nonly the opportunity to talk with the filmmakers afterwards made the movie bearable . \npaulina runs 1 : 28 . \nthe film is in spanish with english subtitles . \nit is not rated but would be an r for violence and nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers . \n'
?,'eight years after its release , disney has decided to re-release the little mermaid theatrically for 17 days ( and 17 long nights ) only . \ncoincidentally , it was reintroduced to theaters the same day fox\'s animated film anastasia was released . \nyou know disney , they can\'t deal with the threat of any other studio getting even a small piece of the crust of the kiddie entertainment pie , so when someone else wants to make a little money , they counter with an old \" masterpiece \" from their vault and , you know what , i went to see this 1989 cartoon rather than the brand new one from fox . \nlet no one say disney is losing its monopoly on the market . \nthey still have hotels on boardwalk _and_ park place . \nbelieve it or not , today , november 25 , 1997 , at 5 : 05 p . m . , i saw the little mermaid for the first time . \nit took me a few years to get over an aversion to this movie that was caused seven years ago , when i stayed with one of my mom\'s friends for a couple weeks . \nthey had a young child who listened to the little mermaid soundtrack constantly and , over that two week period , i heard every song from the movie probably a hundred times . \nby the time i got back home , i promised myself i\'d never see the movie . \nbut promises are made to be broken , especially when you\'re looking at a 17-day , limited engagement . \ndamn those shrewd disney marketers and their mind games . \nthe little mermaid is based on a hans christian anderson fairy tale , but it\'s disney-ized , which means lots of talking animals and bursting into song . \nit also means the heroine is a total babe who shows off cleavage from a seashell bra at all times . \ni never wanted so much to be a pair of shells . . . \nthe heroine , of course , is ariel ( voice of jodi benson ) , a 16-year-old mermaid who is going through that rebellious phase . \nshe skips her concert to explore a wrecked ship and hang out with a seagull that talks like buddy hackett , who tries to orient her to the mysterious world of humans . \nshe\'s also dealing with feelings she hasn\'t had before -- which comes when you get scales in places you didn\'t use to have them -- about a handsome prince ( no disney movie would be complete without one ) . \nher father , king triton of the merpeople , strictly forbids such lusting after the ways of the \" savage \" humans , in a condemnation that reads as a not-so-subtle analogy about old- fashioned parents who forbid interracial dating . \nwhat\'s a king to do , though ? \nthe girl\'s in love and even total destruction of her little shrine to the human world doesn\'t deter her . \nariel saves the prince\'s life when a hurricane rises up , and just has to meet him . \nshe makes a deal with ursula , the sea witch ( voice of pat carroll ) . \nyou know she\'s evil because she has a huge potbelly and one of the worst asses in cartoon history . \nshe also has octopus tentacles for feet ( something those dr . scholl\'s corn pads will not fix ) and offers to help ariel out . \nshe\'ll make her a human for three days if ariel will give up her pretty voice ; ariel has three days to make that prince kiss her , or else she becomes a slave to the witch forever . \nand if she pricks her finger on a sewing machine or eats an evil apple , she\'ll fall asleep forever . \nit\'s a simplistic plot , yes , but the little mermaid was a revolution in the disney world , coming after such lackluster efforts as the black cauldron and oliver and company . \nit ranks as one of the best disney cartoons , certainly since the \'50s . \nall the elements are there -- memorable songs like \" under the sea \" and \" kiss the girl , \" cartoon animals like sebastian and flounder , an evil villain who still has characterization and charm , and a fair amount of humor that caters to adults as well as children . \nthe little mermaid is worth a big-screen ticket in 1997 , so hurry up , you only have five days left . \nserving america for more than 1/25th of a century ! \n'
?,'the following review encompasses two versions of dune : \ndune : the theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives , the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book . \nthe film\'s visual splendour , mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative . \ndune : the extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 189 minutes capsule review : a bit of a throw-together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television . \nit was disowned by director david lynch but it\'s considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline . \nquality dubs of this version from the out-of-print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web . \n * * * the review * * * \nreleased in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of $40 million , the film of frank herbert\'s cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci-fi fans . \ndirector david lynch ( blue velvet , eraserhead , twin peaks ) was working on his biggest production to date , a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico . \nthe screenplay was lynch\'s own , chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected . \ndune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors . \nthe key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis ( dune ) , a windswept desert planet that\'s home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange . \nthe spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe . \nit extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it . \nmost importantly , it allows the navigators of the spacing guild ( once human but now hideously mutated ) to \" fold space \" and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously , enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish . \nlynch\'s film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story\'s two main strands . \none is the long-standing rivalry between two families , houses atreides and house harkonnen , and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis . \nthe second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long-awaited by the natives of arrakis , the fremen . \nthe deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld , and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom . \nunfortunately , this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film , which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended . \nthe thinking among universal\'s oh-so-wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office . \nwith lynch\'s initial cut running at closer to three or more hours , the studio demanded that further cuts be made . \nwhat a great idea ! \nwhy not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible ? \nthe most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative , leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters . \nthus their personalities are vague , their motivations unclear and , in the case of paul\'s father duke leto , their demise rather meaningless . \nthe end result is a distinct chill : we can\'t warm to most of the cast and we don\'t care much for them . \nand it hardly helps that the voice-over narration is sparse and that the dune-esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book . \ndune is also a very serous film . \nthe constant \" self-talk \" by various characters makes it so serious and self-absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment . \nthe overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them . \nhumour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen\'s mad , sadistic kind - is hard to find . \nyou may balk at the comparison , but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus\' star wars trilogy . \nthe theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster , however . \nit still possesses enough of lynch\'s stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative sci-fi . \nspecial effects whiz carlo rambaldi\'s giant sandworms are an awesome sight . \nboth the production design ( anthony masters ) and costume design ( bob ringwood ) are striking and original . \nand the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years . \nwith these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis\' lush cinematography , the film is at least a feast for the senses . \nsee it in the widescreen format if you can . \nand despite all the cuts , several cast members still make a strong impression , most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen . \nsian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam , leader of the bene gesserit religious order who\'s secret aim is to manipulate paul\'s destiny for its own shadowy ends . \nas paul atreides , the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily , but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade . \nthe conclusion ? \nany assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert\'s original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker . \ndavid lynch took a brave stab at it and , partly due to forces beyond his control , ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects . \ndune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release . \nmany chose to stay away altogether , as the film\'s disastrous box office showing attests . \nthe extended version , however , is a rather different beast . \nin 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition \" director\'s cut \" of the film on home video , a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres . \nbut , alas , he failed to do so , choosing to move on to other projects . \nin a way , then , it is partly lynch\'s own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version , put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa . \nstung into action , lynch successfully petitioned the director\'s guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with \" allen smithee \" , the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work . \nhe also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous \" judas booth \" . \ncertainly , looking at the results of mca\'s handiwork there\'s at least half a dozen instances that , for sheer technical sloppiness , are good enough reasons for the director to object . \nbut these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas . \nmost of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration , both of which fill many holes in the original version\'s storyline . \npaul\'s relationship with his father and associates is more intimate , with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously . \nthe political skulduggery involving the emperor , the spacing guild , the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained . \npaul\'s initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably . \nand as further background , a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe . \nas a piece of storytelling , then , mca tv\'s version of dune is clearly superior . \nas a piece of editing , however , it is at times surprisingly inept . \nthe use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough , but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate . \nthere\'s some sloppy cutting , too , and in a few instances shots even appear out of order . \nand the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes ( eg . \nships coming and going , soldiers coming and going ) is at times clearly out-of-context . \nthis is the kind of thing to which lynch objected , and rightly so . \nit should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u . s . television . \nbut the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasn\'t even in herbert\'s book . \nthe scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his \" heart plug \" . \nits a surreal and disturbing episode that\'s very lynch-esque but adds nothing to what we already know : the baron is a nasty piece of work . \ndespite its own peculiar flaws , then , the extended version of dune is a generally superior film . \nall up , it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered , fabricated or newly created sequences . \nunless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart , the \" alan smithee \" version remains the closest we\'ll get to what the movie should have been . \non repeated viewings , one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit . \nstill , as one of this century\'s great science-fiction novels , some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen . \nwith rumours circulating of a new six hour mini-series planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 , it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga . \n'

?,'film adaptation of hunter s . thompson\'s infamous semi-autobiographical hallucinogen-fueled book of the same title . \ndirector terry gilliam of twelve monkeys ( 8/10 ) and brazil ( 7/10 ) fame , took over the helm of this project after fellow director alex cox ( sid and nancy ( 7 . 5/10 ) ) \n \" apparently alienated everyone associated with the movie \" , according to gilliam . \nplot : writer thompson ( depp ) heads down to las vegas with his attorney dr . gonzo ( del toro ) to cover a motorcycle race . \nduring their trip , they systematically consume \" two bags of grass , seventy-five pellets of mescaline , five sheets of high powered blotter acid , a salt shaker half-full of cocaine , a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers , downers , screamers , laughers , a quart of tequila , a quart of rum , a case of beer , a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls . \nthe movie presents us with the results of that heavy drug use . \ncritique : i have given this movie two separate ratings because i believe that the enjoyment of this psychedelic picture is highly correlated with the amount of drugs or alcohol that would be floating around in the viewer\'s own mind , whilst inhaling this cinematic vision of excess . \nif you are prepared to get high or intoxicated before watching this film , i would say that this is one picture that you will thoroughly enjoy on a multitude of colorful levels . \nif , on the other hand , you decide to stray from the addition of nefarious elements to your system , i could not imagine you truly appreciating much of this drug-induced picture\'s entire ride ( 5 . 5/10 for all those sober dogs ) . \nnote : i have not read thompson\'s book . \nhaving said that , joblo did engage in an alcohol-based consumatory session before ( and during ) the viewing of this film , so his critique of the film should be appreciated on that level . \nthis movie relies heavily on style and peculiar humour , rather than substance or plot . \nit moves admirably from one scene to the next , without much basis of their being , while presenting us with the two days in the life of writer hunter s . thompson during which he seemed to consume more drugs and alcohol than anyone could ever imagine . \nit was 1971 , and the times were apparently \" a\' changing \" in the states . \njohnny depp chews into his role like an overgrown child sucking on a chocolate lollipop . \nduring the filming , depp apparently become fast friends with real-life writer thompson , and was known to wander off the set from time to time , for the sake of checking out the newest barmaid at the local watering hole . \ni thought he did seem to exaggerate his walk a little bit too much , but then again , this movie is supposed to be a wild exaggeration of everything and anything , so who am i to talk . \nthe one thing that did blow my mind was the actual physical transformation endured by actor benicio del toro for his role as dr . gonzo . \ni couldn\'t believe that this fat , samoan lawyer , was the same guy who played the slick mumbling criminal in the usual suspects ( 7 . 5/10 ) . \nword on the street is that gained over 40 pounds for this role , and i must say that his look was deliciously reprehensible . \nplenty of cameos also pepper this kaleidoscopic moving picture in the form of ellen barkin , christina ricci , tobey maguire and cameron diaz , along with a bunch of others . \nother than that , the soundtrack was expectedly eclectic , the style was not as wild as i thought it would be , and the ending was certainly not much of a barn-burner , but then again , who really noticed . \nthis movie is about visions of bats floating through your head , johnny depp looking goofy and being bald , and the cornucopia of drug-ravaged scenes filling your own intoxicated system with ideas of anarchy , rebellion and the lost american dream . \nand for all those who plan on seeing this movie without the partnership of a mean drink or a mighty doobie , i suggest you move further down the aisle , buy yourself a ticket to godzilla ( 6/10 ) , and enjoy the visual fabrications manufactured for the unstimulated mind . \nlittle known facts : depp and del toro snorted plenty of powdered milk instead of cocaine . \nbill murray also portrayed a thompson-based character in the film where the buffalo roam . \njohnny depp turned down roles in the three musketeers , speed ( 7 . 5/10 ) , and legends of the fall ( 7 . 5/10 ) , for smaller and quirkier roles in benny and joon ( 6 . 5/10 ) and what\'s eating gilbert grape ?

?,'recently i read 4 reviews of pleasantville-one from entertainment weekly , one from a newsgroup , and two from different online resources . \neach review compared this film to the truman show . \nwhy ? \nthe only reason people compared pleasantville to truman is due to the fact that their lives are on television . \nother than that , the two movies are completely different from each other . \nreviewers seem to love to pick one movie ( i . e . \nthe truman show ) , obsess over it , and make it a guideline for other movies . \nwhen pleasantville and edtv opened , all critics seemed to treat the two films like they were subjects of king truman . \nthe same goes for the thin red line , as well . \nwhen it opened in decemeber , probably 98\% of reviews compared it to stephen spielberg\'s saving private ryan , giving thin line no chance whatsoever . \ncritics loved private ryan so much , that they automatically decided no movie is good enough to reach its standards . \nthis is why i think pleasantville was underrated . \nif the truman show had never been made , pleasantville probably would have received better reviews , done better at the box office , and would be remembered after it\'s long been on the video store shelves . \nsure , it wasn\'t perfect , and it wasn\'t very believeable , but neither was the wizard of oz or star wars , and there stands two of the most prominent movies in history . \nwith the exception of don knotts as the annoying \" tv repairman \" the film is cast perfectly : the ice storm\'s tobey maguire is david in real life ; he watches the old 50\'s sitcom \" pleasantville \" to escape from his feuding parents . \nhis twin sister , jen ( reese witherspoon ) is a popular slut who ( steriotypically ) smokes and wears revealing clothes . \nbut what makes her character believeable is the dialogue-those excessive 90\'s terms such as \" like \" , \" whatever \" , and \" cool \" make her sound like the total dimwit she\'s supposed to be . \nthe twins , with a little help from a tv repairman ( casting don knotts in this role was obviously a cameo-esque cast rather than a true acting one ) , are sucked into pleasantville by a magical new remote . \ntheir new parents , played by william h . macy and joan allen , are perfect in every way . \ntheir new names are bud and mary sue , and right away they start to corrupt the town of pleasantville . \nafter the siblings fit comfortably in their new roles , the movie begins to take form . \nit\'s just like watching a sitcom in itself ; you don\'t want it to end . \n \" mary sue \" has sex with her date , the school basketball champion ; when he tells all his friends about it , they stop preforming perfectly at basketball , and things start to take color . \nsoon we learn that these people don\'t know how to express true emotions , and when they learn to do so , they eventually turn into color . \nthis eventually sparks a racial war between the \" coloreds \" and the \" black & whites . \" \nentertainment weekly reviewer lisa schwarzbaum claims the movie has , \" none of the depth , poignance , and brilliance of the truman show . . . \" \nyes , the truman show was maybe a little more intelligent . \nbut the racial setting-intensified by the forcing of the coloreds to sit in the upper box of the courtroom-certainly classifies as deep , considering it\'s what i least expected . \ngary ross did not try to create an intelligent , award masterpiece-he just tries to convey moral messages within his work . \ntake for example big and dave , his past films . \nbig-be careful what you wish for . \ndave-good or bad lying is still lying . \ndid these movies win big awards ? \nno , but they won the heart of millions . \npleasantville could have done that too , if it wasn\'t for snotty reviewers who set precedents with preceeding films . \npleasantville : a- ad2am \" i almost lost my nose . . . and \ni like it . \ni like breathing through it . \" \n-jack nicholson , chinatown \n'

?,'remember back in the mid 1990s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage ? \n \" pulp fiction \" and \" fargo \" both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture , and not surprisingly , a slew of rip-offs followed in the years thereafter . \nthat fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing \" the way of the gun \" that at first glance looks like another of those wanna-be\'s but upon closer inspection doesn\'t look like anything comprehendable . \nit\'s a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere - a film that won\'t allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous . \ncomplexity should come as no surprise to anyone who\'s familiar with mcquarrie , he wrote \" the usual suspects , \" which has become a cult favorite despite little critical acclaim . \nthat film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate , confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings . \nyou have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that \" if it\'s really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating . \" \nwith \" the way of the gun \" mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea , but this time the story is far less commercial - a shame because maybe that would have helped . \nthe film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely a reason to live but aren\'t hell-bent on death either ( played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro ) . \nthey get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a big-shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization . \nthey figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother ( played by juliette lewis ) and get a nice ransom . \nalong the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec , his wife , their hired goons and the \" bag man \" ( played by james caan - the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what he\'s doing ) . \nthe exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously can\'t call the authorities for help . \nhis goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers\' trail and each make different offers to get the mother back . \nthe exec\'s son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right . \nmeanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the double-crosses , secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all . \nmcquarrie doesn\'t know the meaning of the word simple . \nhe seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie . \neverything has to be complicated and confusing , so much so that it\'s to the point of surrealism . \nnothing is what it seems in this reality , it\'s one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industry\'s rules and regulations . \nevery scene with caan\'s character exemplifies this perfectly - the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him , getting into conversations about \" the business \" and how it works and we\'re hardly given a clue as to what they\'re talking about . \nthese characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but they\'re more like ideas ripped-off from sketches found in david mamet\'s trash . \nno one here really acts like a real person , and the story is even further removed from reality . \nit\'s like a dream without any appeal . \ntake the opening scene for example ; the phillipe and del toro characters are in a parking lot across the street from a bar or a club counting their money and stuff . \nthey sit on a brand-new mercedes and the car alarm goes off , the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they don\'t move . \nthe guy and his loud-mouth , potty-mouth girlfriend and about 20 other people cross the street and gang up on them . \nyou\'d think phillipe ? and del toro are ? going to pull out guns and scare them away but they don\'t , instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by a mob . \nthere\'s a lot of things i didn\'t understand about this scene : first of all the owner of the mercedes isn\'t some yuppie or old rich snob , he\'s like a hippie straight out of the 60s . \nsecondly , the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed . \nlastly , it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than a small country\'s army . \nif they were suicidal they wouldn\'t have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place ( and where they get all those guns is never explained either ) . \nthere\'s a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility . \nwhat it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems - which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is . \nabsolutely none of the characters are likable or believable . \nand it\'s all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not a flat-out black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time . \nwith any film you see , whether you like it or not , you can at least understand what the appeal was to it , why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it . \ni can\'t say either for \" the way of the gun , \" because it has very little going for it and i can\'t imagine anyone intelligently defending it . \n'
?,'tempe mills cinema , az--this movie had us in non-stop stitches from beginning to end . \nall those promotional clips that have been on tv for the past month came from the first five minutes of the movie . \nif you thought they were funny , see the rest of the movie . \nit\'s hilarious . \nhow does one go about making a movie about a couple guys whose only claim to fame is synchronized head-bopping on snl to exactly one song ? \neasy . \nwrite an interesting script around tried-and-true ideas , add some good lines and satire , and voil ? , you end up with an excellent , well-done , very entertaining flick . \nwill and chris are idiot brothers forced by their father to work begrudgingly in the family flower business during the day . \nat night they pursue their life-long ambition to loose their virginity in failed attempts to get into the roxbury in beverly hills , ca , the only disco act worth going to . \nthe only problem , the place is so popular and the waiting line so long that by the time the brothers make it to the front door , the roxbury closes , all the while bearing witness to guys with one-hundred-dollar bills and movie stars like richard grieco who get past the doorman without fuss . \nthe script authors ( steve koren , will ferrell and chris kattan ) cleverly devised a way for our boys to get into the roxbury . \ntheir flower-shop van is rear-ended by richard grieco , who fears a law-suit and is surprised to see the idiots are too star-struck to think about the car accident they just had , but not about getting into the roxbury . \ngrieco happily takes them in , even introduces them to the owner , which has the added benefit of enhancing the financial appearance of the idiot brothers in the eyes of a couple of gold diggers ( elisa donovan and gigi rice ) who bet their time and bodies on will and chris . \nwhat follows are some of the best slap-stick dancing routines ever . \nthe music is superb , and could have only been made better had the producers added patrick hernandez\'s born to be alive . \nthe choreography at times was a parody of an era gone by , for example , the bee gees and their stayin\' alive . \nit is nostalgic for those of us who remember that far back , and the technique is a clever adaptation that worked well in forest gump . \none of the funniest scenes is when the gold diggers discover that will \nand chris don\'t have any mone y , and dump both on the spot , even expressing violence and anger that they gave sex away . \nan art-imitates-life poke at shallow women . \nit\'s a scene that\'s an approximate parody of the vinegar\'s own rolf luedeke\'s editorial this week national organization for men ( nom ) replaces now . \nted \" unabomber \" \nkaczynski , himself rejected for not having money , will identify well with this scene , if he ever watches the movie . \nof course , the script wouldn\'t be complicated enough without adding molly shannon , the girl next door who has had a crush on will since they were kids , and who will has had an aversion to in quest of good-looking disco blondes ( proof that men will turn down perfectly good women when there are bay watch babes always lurking nearby ) . \nnevertheless , will\'s father wants him to marry molly anyway , but thinks idiot chris is standing in the way and sends him into guest-quarter exile . \nduring the wedding ceremony , will\'s heart isn\'t exactly into getting married , and when his brother appears on the balcony with a ghetto blaster and more head-bopping music , will thinks worse of the knot-tieing idea and runs to chris . \ndefinitely an snl parody of the graduate where katharine ross changed her mind for the screaming dustin hoffman in the church balcony . \ni found this scene a riot , however , it went over brandi\'s head -- she was born seven years after the graduate first appeared . \nthe scene has a good punch line when molly shannon marries , instead , the step-in buddy/weight-lifter ( who looks like he could pass for the son of gary busy ) and who has been lusting for a good-looker for a long time , but ready now to take anyone . \nmore art-imitates-life stuff -- not even muscles can substitute for money in the real world . \nthe idiots\' mother is played by loni anderson , whose barbie-doll looks \ndon\'t play well anymore ( she\'s a bit old ) , and whose cleavage looks like someone botched a tracheotomy too low down . \ni recommend this movie for anyone who wants to have a lot of fun or in \nneed of a lot of laughs . \ngo with a date . \nbrandi laughed non-stop , as i \ndid , and a deaf-mute might have concluded i was tickling her continuously for 105 minutes . \n'
?,'john von neumann , progenitor of the computer age and critically important mathematician on the manhattan project , pointed out long ago that there is a great way to explore the cosmos , even without recourse to faster-than light travel . \nyou send out self-replicating robot ships which explore and radio back information . \nit may take decades , centuries , or millennia , but it can be done with achievable technology , and doesn\'t require a magical faster-than-light drive . \nin the fifties , british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer and a program for it ; any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer , which would then engage in a real-time dialog with the aliens , exchanging information and technologies , and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned . \nabout thirty-five years ago , the bbc contracted with astronomer/writer fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a mini-series called a for andromeda . \nafa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission , the construction of a huge computer , the computer\'s analysis of life on earth , and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication . \nshe was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the then-unknown julie christie . \naudience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel , andromeda breakthrough , which played to equally high ratings . \ndennis feldman , whose previous credits include the golden child , has never been noted for coherent , well-structured movie scripts ; they start out great , and then disintegrate into a morass of chase and action , mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl . \nfeldman writes good scenes , but has no idea how to tell a story or write a movie , even with a previous version to use as a model . \nnow , in species , we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline , derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined by a mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter , gore , and chases . \nspecies features ben kingsley , who is completely wasted in a badly-written portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist . \nforest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script . \nthe species story is relatively simple ; we have been radioing information about ourselves and our dna out into space since 1971 , and have been receiving answers for two years . \n ( note that , in the 1970\'s , we really didn\'t know diddly about the human genome structure , and were hardly in a position to radio out a set of blueprints for human beings . \neven today , all we can do is give information about dna and how it works , not a copy of human dna , because we don\'t have it analyzed yet . ) \nthe answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating a member of the alien race , and doctor xavier finch , played by ben kingsley , is placed in charge of the attempt . \nthe script begins to go off the deep end at this point , when the result is a beautiful young girl who can shape-shift into any of several ugly alien life forms . \nthe first half of the film has something to offer , as \" sil , \" the alien girl , struggles with her multi-form existence , changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again , all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos . \nshe seems oddly knowledgeable about human society , with glaring gaps where her social skills should be . \nher instincts are to mate and procreate , and some of the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area . \nescaping from her birth laboratory in utah , sil is pursued by a team of drafted civilians with orders to find her and kill her . \nshe goes on an eating binge , spins herself a cocoon , and emerges as an adult , played by natasha henstridge , who goes a long way toward re-creating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in 1960 . \nthe pursuers : michael madsen is an assassin/exterminator ; forrest whitaker is a convenient empath/psychic , just as though the u . s . government actually had such people on call . \nneither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided . \nwhitaker\'s role seems to be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trek : the next generation\'s \" counselor cleavage . \" \nthe other members of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger and alfred molina . \nkingsley and whitaker are both consummate professionals , too good to not work to the best of their abilities ; but the performances donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland , and it is apparent that the direction was a bit weak . \nh . r . giger\'s design for the main form of the alien creature is actually a bit boring when we finally get to see it , although previous digital effects were done quite smoothly . \nthe main fault of species is lack of originality ; it starts out with a wonderful , albeit borrowed , premise , and then doesn\'t live up to it . \nall we get are chase scenes and a few nice sex scenes , with a few monsters tossed in . \nthere is no buildup of tension and suspense , no climax worthy of the name ; species is just a sequence of \" scare \" scenes stuck together . \nthe movie is carried by its chase and sex scenes , but not rescued by them . \non the other hand , as an exercise in sci-fi action/ adventure , it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd . \nspecies earns an extra rating point or two for having ben kingsley and natasha henstridge on board , but by and large , it\'s fun only for those of us who really like this sort of thing . \nmy personal rating is three stars , but knock one or two of those off if you don\'t enjoy pretty unclothed ladies and bloodthirsty alien monsters . \nmpaa classification : r ( violence , gore , nudity , sex , language ) \nstars : ben kingsley , michael madsen , forest whitaker , alfred molina , marg helgenberger , natasha henstridge directed by : roger donaldson produced by : frank mancuso jr . and dennis feldman typed by : dennis feldman cinematography : andrzej bartkowiak music : christopher young run time : 108 minutes aspect ratio : 2 . 35 : 1 from mgm , opens 7 july 1995 \n'

?,'after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project , making the third installment in the godfather-trilogy . \nthis new film has been underrated for no reason . \nit is as intellectual and majestically made as copolla\'s pervious films . \nit is also more psychological , pessimistic and more tragic than the first two . \nthe only regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla and some \" unfinished \" developments of some characters . \nthe film elegantly begins with nino rota\'s recognizable musical score , the beautiful skyscrapers of new york and michael\'s voice as he is writing a letter to his children : \" the only wealth in this world is children . \nmore than all money and power on earth , you are my treasure \" . \nthe year is 1979 and michael corleone has used the time since the ending of \" part ii \" to make his father\'s dream come true - making the corleone family legitimate . \nmichael sold all his casinos and invests only in gambling . \nconstantly haunted by the past , his only reason to live is his children . \nthe family has amassed unimaginable wealth , and as the film opens michael corleone ( al pacino ) is being invested with a great honor by the church . \nlater that day , at a reception , his daughter announces a corleone family gift to the church and the charities of sicily , \" a check in the amount of $100 million . \" \nbut the corleones are about to find , as others have throughout history , that you cannot buy forgiveness . \nsure , you can do business with evil men inside the church , for all men are fallible and capable of sin . \nbut god does not take payoffs . \nthe plot of the movie , concocted by coppola and mario puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines , brings the corleone family into the inner circles of corruption in the vatican . \nthere is a moment in \" godfather iii \" where michael says : \" all my life i have been trying to go up in society , where everything was legal . \nbut the higher i go , the crookier it becomes . . \" \n . \nvisually this film is as spectacular as the first two . \ngordon willis\' rich cinematography , carmine copolla\'s beautiful composition and alex tavoularis\' wonderful art direction could not be better . \nbut copolla\'s first two godfather-films were more famous for their deep , intellectual plots , tree dimensional characters and incredible acting , than for their visual perfection . \nthe third installment has only the plot and visuals . \nsome characters could be much more developed and the acting , although good , never accomplishes to reach the same height of the first two films . \nthe biggest miscasting is sofia copolla , who is so unconvincing and unemotional that she manages to ruin several scenes throughout the movie , that could have been grander and more emotional . \nthe best performance comes unsurprisingly from al pacino , who should have got a nomination for best actor at the oscars . \nandy garcia is powerful as sonny\'s son , strong , focused and loyal . \nviolence is natural to him . \nhe suffers no pangs of conscience when he takes revenge on his family\'s behalf , and in this he is supposed to be strong in the uncomplicated way don vito corleone was . \nhowever both kay ( diane keaton ) and connie ( talia shire ) are useless . \nand characters like vito corleone and tom hagen are really missed . \nthe good part is that michael is again reunited with old friends , that you remember from the first and second films . \nin the third film michael has become almost like his father , vito in the first film and vincenzo resembles michael when he was much younger . \nthis parallel could be more interesting if vincenzo\'s character was more developed . \nmany have pointed out that making the third film , was unnecessary . \ni disagree . \nit is a beautiful film of great importance , completing the tragic saga of the corleone family . \nthe first film showed some horrible results of corleone\'s life . \nit showed michael making a choice ; the second showed a man damning himself for his choices and feeling the impact of changing times . \na man desperately trying to keep his balance , focus , family and sanity , while everything is crashing all around him . \nthe third film is a terrifying conclusion - a result of michael\'s life . \nthe life he chose for himself is like quicksand - one wrong step and you are doomed . \nthere is no turning back . \nand no matter how hard you try to get out of it , to free yourself , no matter how powerful and wealthy you are , you are helpless - sinking deeper and deeper till it swallows you completely . \nthe beautifully directed last sequence is also the powerful climax of the film , when michael is sitting alone in his chair , left by everyone , surrounded by emptiness and memories of his friends and family members long dead . \nhere he dies - alone , miserable and unforgiven \n'
?,'seen april 16 , 1999 at 10 p . m . at crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n . y . ) , theater #15 , by myself for free using my hoyts\' critic\'s pass . \n[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good seats , sound and picture] \ndo you realize that every time you encounter a new person you\'ve just become part of a story ? \neveryone has their own life story , both past and present , and every time two or more interact , they become part of each others\' story ( not necessarily an important or even significant part , but a part nevertheless ) . \nthat seems to be the basic theory behind `go , \' where several characters\' chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways . \nin order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldn\'t usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them , such as a teenage supermarket cashier , a bottom-of-the-drug-food-chain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors . \nthese types of characters might not sound all that original , but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father , a mid-level drug dealer , a narc obsessed with multi-level-marketing , horny wedding guests , a zen lovemaker , two shrimp-scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out . \nhow they will all come together is the process the film deals with . \ni\'d imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators\' testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general . \nthe film starts out as anything else , with little indication of what\'s to come . \nwe meet ronna ( polley ) , a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn\'t seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent . \nshe\'s not very charming , especially to her customers , but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works . \nmaybe this is because she\'s not a very afeminite character , but she\'s far from masculine - a creative character indeed . \nthings start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy , hyperactive , yet likable simon ( askew ) , an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences . \nthis agreement starts a three-pronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug . \nthe process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death . \nnearly the same can be said for two other characters , zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) , who we don\'t think much of when they first appear as supporting characters , but later will become major players to the film\'s makeup - another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be . \nonce the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle . \nwhen the title screen `ronna\' is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene , it\'s clear this film isn\'t going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling . \nconsidering how good it is up until that point , it\'s a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today . \nand so the film begins to take shape , first by following ronna and her friends on a one-night adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam ( who were actually looking for simon ) , which doesn\'t exactly go as planned , but that\'s what keeps it all so interesting . \nthe second storyline starts at the same moment as ronna\'s story , but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead . \nsimon and his three friends head to ? vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined . \nthe third arc , about zack and adam , again overlaps with ronna\'s story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle . \nwe\'re shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna . \nand many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam aren\'t even their fault - they just happened to be where they were when they were . \ni\'d really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end , but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who haven\'t seen the film . \nperhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability , and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay , just through great filmmaking . \nstill , i can list and analyze nearly everything the film does so well : \n ? direction : trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task and for a rookie filmmaker such as liman , it\'s a great accomplishment . \nhe doesn\'t just depict a story , he wraps us up in it all , pulling us into the fray so that we experience every high and low . \n ? screenplay : besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general , it\'s clear the script has been inspired by many sources , with both obvious and subtle references , yet it never screams `rip-off . \' \n ? tone/mood : where other hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of the independents to the mainstream , this one is able to create its own sense of the macabre . \nit\'s not overly-dark or twisted and the comedy isn\'t so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy , more like `macabre light . \' \n ? cinematography/art direction : able to photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner . \n ? characterization : for nearly every character introduced , no matter what role they play in the big picture , we\'re able to get a sense of who they are , what they\'re thinking and how they came to be in their situations . \neven when their actions are surprising , it never seems very out of synch . \n ? performances : every actor nails their role ( see above ) . \n ? theme/theory : the film doesn\'t seem to be concerned with conveying any kind of political or social messages , instead , it\'s more of a philosophical experiment . \nin fact , it might not have meant to do that intentionally , but there definitely is something existential to it all . \n . . . and to think that `go\' is just a big comedy and adventure ! \n ( 4/23/99 ) [see also : `the big lebowski , \' `clerks , \' `jackie brown , \' `pulp fiction , \' `true romance ; \' also by liman : `swingers\'] \n'
?,'when i was asked to see this movie with a friend , my initial reaction was ? not hugh grant ! \' \ni was perhaps wrong to be so harsh , but after his insidious flirtation with a street hooker , i just could not picture him in any romantic lead . \nwhat makes this movie a wonderful experience is not the fact it stars hugh , but because it stars julia and carries with it a brilliantly written script . \nthis writer richard curtis , whose exceptional first work ? four weddings and funeral\' shows us that he is a master in the domain of the romantic comedy , with splashes of drama thrown in between . \nhugh and his hair , is almost identical to the character that made him famous in ? four weddings\' . \nhe plays an ordinary guy who is down and out on his luck . \nunfortunately , he is type cast in this role , but fortunately it works well for him in this movie . \nif only he would dither a little less . \njulia knows this role well . \nthe glamorous movie star who is searching for true love . \nthere are moments in this movie , that you almost weep for her pain felt loneliness . \nhow sad it must be to be so wealthy and beautiful , but to have no one to share it with . \nthe writer deals with difficult issues of love and social class on various levels . \nhow differences in social standing can make it almost impossible for love to grow in such a harsh environment . \nhow the media can be as cruel as it can be attentive , and how fulfilment in life and love can be found in forgiveness and sacrifice . \n'
?,'you\'d think it would be easy to spoof star trek , but try spoofing it without cruelly mocking it . \nthat\'s a bit more difficult . \nthe farfetched sci-fi series is , after all , enormously popular , what with its gigantic fan base and ongoing installments both on television and in movies . \nif you\'re not nice to it , you lose . \ngalaxy quest is to star trek what mel brooks\'s spaceballs was to star wars , an affectionate , riotously funny parody that freely takes jabs at various elements of its subject but never seems mean-spirited or malintentioned . \n \" the show\'s been cancelled , but the journey is far from over . \" \nthat is the current tagline of \" galaxy quest , \" a star trek - type show that\'s no longer produced but lives on forever in reruns . \nit also lives on in conventions , gatherings of the show\'s obsessive fans who never fail to dress in \" galaxy quest \" costumes and ask absurdly logical questions about its delirious technobabble . \njason nesmith ( tim allen ) played \" commander peter quincy taggart \" on the show and is the only one of the cast who still gets excited about the gigs they have to do . \nthe attitudes of the rest -- tommy webber ( daryl mitchell , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) , fred kwan ( tony shalhoub ) and alexander dane ( alan rickman ) -- range from indifference to utter contempt . \ndane , who played a spock-like alien , is especially disgusted , considering himself above his demeaning job and stubbornly refusing to recite his character\'s cheesy trademark line \" by grabthar\'s hammer , you shall be avenged \" ( or something like that ) for his die-hard fans . \none day , nesmith is greeted by an especially fanatical group of \" galaxy quest \" followers . \nthey are actually aliens from a planet known as thermia . \nthey have mistaken the \" galaxy quest \" episodes for historical documentation of actual heroic space travel . \nthe next day , the thermians whisk nesmith away to a spaceship to help them defeat the evil sarris ( named , in one of the film\'s only mean-spirited gags , after village voice film critic andrew sarris ) . \nnesmith thinks it is only an elaborate gig , and sort of blows it off , but when he is transported -- or i should say shot -- back to earth in a rather celestial manner , he believes . \nnext thing the cast knows , they are being dragged by nesmith to this spaceship . \nof course , they all think he is out of his mind and once he does convince them that there really is a spaceship , what they want to do is get out of there as fast as the transporters will take them . \nbut after some persuading , they stay on to fight the icky sarris and find a way to provide a peaceful existance for the flailing thermians . \ni was quite surprised how well this comedy , which came off as utterly brainless from its marketing campaign , worked . \ntaking shots at both the obvious and not-so-obvious elements of star trek and its fandom , galaxy quest never goes for cheap laughs , opting instead for broad but smart parody . \nnothing is safe -- not the cliches , not the fans , not the absurd taglines -- but on the other hand , everything is safe , since galaxy quest treats its subject with utter respect and sometimes even subtle admiration . \nthe highlight of the movie is tony shalhoub\'s fred a . k . a . tech sergeant chen who , when in character , is the complete opposite of scotty from the original star trek . \nwhile scotty , who was the technician for the enterprise would constantly yell \" i need more power down here captain ! \" , \nchen\'s cry for help is more to the tune of \" the core , like , won\'t take it or something . \" \nit\'s a hoot , but it doesn\'t stop there : weaver , whose character has the menial task of repeating everything the computer says and rickman , with his relentlessly holier-than-thou attitude aren\'t far behind . \ngalaxy quest succeeds as a funny parody of star trek and while it\'s not a masterpiece -- it tends to falter in its more serious moments -- it is immensely entertaining fluff and excellent counterprogramming to all the sober oscar contenders being released this holiday season . \nby grabthar\'s hammer , this is a hell of a movie . \n'
?,'i was originally going to give the spanish prisoner two and half stars . \nfrom my first viewing , i noticed that david mamet\'s film was intense and clever at times but boring and cliched at other times especially at the beginning . \nfrom my second viewing however , i noticed that mamet\'s script was actually a masterpiece . \nthe spanish prisoner , like the usual suspects or chinatown , begs for the viewer\'s complete attention . \nmiss a scene or even a small detail , and you could miss the meaning of the entire film . \nalso like the aforementioned films , it rewards its viewer for paying attention by delivering a surprising and memorable ending . \nmamet is success doing again what he once tackled in 1987 when he wrote and directed house of games . \nlike his past gem , the spanish prisoner fools the audience as much ( or even more ) than the victim . \nbecause we were deceived just like the victim , we feel a strong attachment to the main character and consequently are more interested in the film . \nmamet has the talent of not completely ending a film gift wrapped , but rather leaving some ambiguity towards the end . \nthe power that he has in forcing the viewer to determine who the good guys and bad guys are once the film is over , without giving a right answer , is unique and ingenious . \nthe spanish prisoner will leave you seriously puzzled and intrigued . \nafter seeing the film again , i noticed that the details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening . \nhis direction is very subtle ; as he leaves so many clues explaining what is going on and who is who but it is still very difficult to tell what exactly is happening even if you see all of them , or think you see all of them . \nthe story follows a young up and coming businessman , joe ross , ( campbell scott ) who has just created a mysterious and lucrative \" process \" that everyone is trying to get their hands on . \nsoon ross does not know who he can trust or who is after his \" process . \" \nthrough his journey ross meets a number of mysterious characters : the rich and popular jimmy dell , a secretary who has a huge crush on ross , and ross\' boss mr . klein . \nplayed by steve martin , rebecca pidgeon , and ben gazarra respectively , the supporting cast is very solid especially martin , who deserved an oscar nomination for his commanding and manipulative role . \nthe most interesting character in the film , though , was campbell scott\'s joe ross . \nthe character\'s transformation from an ingenuous and polite rookie to a paranoid veteran is very apparent and justifiable . \ndavid mamet\'s script is so interesting because we know people don\'t actually talk like the characters in the film , yet we feel so connected to some of them . \nhis beguiling style could fool any viewer up for the challenge . \nthis is a must see , for those interested in solving a complex puzzle of a movie . \n'
?,'after the terminally bleak reservoir dogs and the brutally violent pulp fiction , jackie brown seems like something of a light-hearted departure for quentin tarantino . \nit\'s more of a ho-hum heist story with characters that speak the tarantino language . \nluckily , his showcase of actors convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen , and jackie brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer . \nthe story introduces us to a street-wise black woman named jackie brown ( pam grier ) , a flight attendant who smuggles money and drugs from one destination to another . \nshe works for a bottom-of-the-barrel airline and receives a minimal salary . \nbut one day , she is picked up by a pair of federal officials ( including michael keaton as the tough-nosed ray nicolet ) , and found with a handsome load of cash and a small bag of smuggled dope . \njackie is working for a weapons dealer named ordell ( samuel l . jackson ) , who pays her bail money but suspects her of tipping off the feds about their operation . \nsoon jackie and ordell are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 through to them under nicolet\'s nose , with the help of ordell\'s oaf of a partner ( robert de niro ) and drugged-out lady friend ( bridget fonda ) . \nalso entering the picture is a bail-bondsman named max cherry ( robert forster ) , who takes a liking to jackie and agrees at one point to make the situation even more complicated ( how i won\'t say ) . \nthe big drop-off is undoubtedly the high point of jackie brown , in which numerous double-crosses take place and many clothing store bags ( filled with cash ) switch hands . \nit\'s unfortunate that tarantino takes his sweet time getting there , and doesn\'t offer anything extremely compelling while doing so . \nthere are , as always , amusing exchanges between characters . \nthe funniest repartee is between de niro and fonda , as he becomes annoyed with her constant bickering while making fun of his iq , or lack thereof . \nthe most interesting relationship is between max and jackie . \na 56-year old white bail bondsman and a 44-year old black flight attendant with believable chemistry ? \nyou\'ve got to commend the acting . \njackie brown is a seriously dragged-out exercise enlivened by such fine acting . \nthe film clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours , 35 minutes . \ntarantino\'s talky style manages to hold your attention heavily , but there are more than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline . \nalso , fans of the director should be prepared for a lighter side to appear . \njackie brown has four major shootings , and two of those take place mostly off-screen , so don\'t be expecting a typical tarantino bloodbath . \nyou can expect frequent foul language , mostly coming way of ordell , who ( much to the dismay of spike lee ) uses the `n\' word as part of his regular vocabulary . \nthe acting is the glue that holds everything together . \ngrier , making a sudden comeback from her reign in the 1970\'s , is more than adequate for the title character . \nin fact , she\'s flat-out great . \nanother comeback comes from former tv star robert forster , who does a grand job as max cherry , and is perfectly cast in doing so . \nmichael keaton makes his presence felt , albeit in small but dignified moments , and de niro is ideal in playing the lug-head who goes over the edge . \nspeaking of that , bridget fonda has relatively little to do as ordell\'s bikini-clad beach babe , and yet she manages to look fairly occupied . \nthere\'s not a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line throughout the entire movie . \nwhich is a life-saver for mr . tarantino . \nthe story barely holds together in the meantime , and we merely get a small tremor whenever there should be a defeaning earthquake . \nbut oh well . \njackie brown manages to be an enjoyable detour from quentin tarantino , even if it is lacking the glaring and original bite of his previous work . \nlet\'s just hope that the director hasn\'t gone soft on us . \n'
?,'starring shawnee smith ; donovan leitch ; ricky paull goldin ; kevin dillon & billy beck the blob is the remake of the 1960\'s classic ( a term that i use very loosely to define the original ) about a really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets in its way . \nnow the original version has the virtue of cheesy special effects which give it a kind of nostalgic campy feel . \nthe fact that steve mcqueen was the star of the film doesn\'t exactly hurt it either . \nfast forward to the late \'80\'s . \nsteve mcqueen isn\'t in the remake ( this might have something to do with the fact that he had been pushing up daisies for years ) . \nnor is there any hollywood heavy hitters in the lead role . \nthat is unless you count matt dillon\'s brother kevin as a hollywood heavy hitter . \nthe other thing that works against this new blob is that special effects technology has improved dramatically since the original . \nthe only things you need now to have great special effects in a movie are deep pockets . \nit looks as if the produces of the new blob had a couple of holes in their pockets . \nthe special effects in this movie are cheesy , like the original\'s . \nunlike the original , they don\'t look campy , they just look cheap . \none bright spot in the movie from a purely sexist point of view is shawnee smith . \nshe is very attractive and can actually act , which is more than i can say about some of her costars . \nin terms of plot , a little ball of pink goop falls from the sky . \nseems this goop was an experiment that was being housed up on a satellite . \nanyway , the pink stuff has a taste for humans . \nthe more people it absorbs , the bigger it gets . \nand it isn\'t the friendliest goop on the block either . \nanyway , it attacks this little town and it\'s up to the attractive local teenage population to stop it . \nnot really , but that is how it seems . \nthis version attempts to recapture the camp of the original . \nas i\'ve already said , this new version of the blob comes off more as cheap , badly acted , and badly written than campy . \nin the years since this film was made none of the cast have gone on to greatness . \nalthough , star shawnee smith had a very tiny role in armageddon . \nthe reason that we have never heard of any of them again is quite simple -- they all stunk out loud . \nalthough some of the film\'s smaller roles are filled with some actors that , while not big stars , are doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting roles in other movies and tv shows . \nit also appears that the producers of the blob tried to compensate for the lack of a special effects budget by making the scenes in which the blob makes meals of the townsfolk as gory as possible . \nsadly , it doesn\'t work very well . \nif you want to see a big ball of goop terrorize a town , then i would say that you should skip the remake and rent the original . \n ( although that isn\'t so hot either . ) \nthis newest version is seriously lacking in any redeeming qualities . \n'
?,'there\'s a thin line between satire and controversy , and mike nichols ( the birdcage , wolf ) has directed a sharp and very honest look at a us presidential election . \nbased on the book written by \" anonymous \" ( actually former \" newsweek \" writer joe klein ) , john travolta plays governor jack stanton . \nbut he doesn\'t actually play stanton . \nhe plays bill clinton ; just the same as emma thompson no doubt plays the first lady and billy bob thorton is the campaign manipulator james carville ( although the credits will of course say otherwise ) . \nthe film is taken from the perspective of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , a morally correct and somewhat hesitant new advisor to stanton . \nhe searches for justice and dignity in the ugliest possible situations , and whether it be keeping the history of his boss\' pants under wraps or contemplating digging up dirt on another politician , he approaches his work with a keen desire to skillfully serve his country and his fellow workers . \nrichard jemmons ( billy bob thorton ) and daisy green ( maura tierney ) team up with henry as the would-be president\'s advisors , and hire lesbian veteran libby holden ( kathy bates ) as the campaign\'s eccentric \" tougher than dirt \" incriminator . \ntogether they face all sorts of sexual allegations , the irritatingly discourteous media and other witty politicians in the election race . \nin its satire and controversy , primary colors is a similar film to wag the dog : they both are not afraid to wipe their noses in the nitty-gritty and take a bold look at something that will never has honesty as a virtue . \nbut whereas wag showed us how much affect a few people can have on the media , primary colors is much more concerned with fleshing out it\'s characters , letting us understand what they want and why , and making us truly appreciate the humanity and rectitude that they graciously represent . \nseeing john travolta play bill clinton so confidently and justly is enough to make the film more than worth a look . \nand the rest of the cast also make superb performances - adrian lester sharply portrays the intellect of henry whilst kathy bates is perfect as the robust and energetic libby holden . \nat occasions , you can\'t help but feel that these terrific characters are going to waste . \nthere are long slabs of time where john travolta ( unquestionably the most interesting to watch ) is missed from the screen ; and since it is awkwardly structured as henry\'s story we are often forced to watch scenes that perhaps are not so necessary to the central plot - or even the point of the film . \nhaving said that , make no mistake - primary colors is always enjoyable to watch . \nbut frequently we have to ask ourselves - exactly what are we watching ? \nmost of the first half of its duration is a lightheaded look at melodramatic confrontations that seem so genuine we cannot help but laugh , but the way primary colors chooses to finish tackles aspects that are very contrary , and almost unsuitable , to the rest of the film . \nbut as i mentioned before , there is a thin line between satire and controversy - and for the most part , primary colors delivers an entertaining indulgence of political matters combined with a far-from-overpowering look at winning the public\'s opinion . \nalthough at occasions the film may jump around a little too freely , focus is never lost on how important and vulnerable the subject matter really is . \nthankfully , it is clear to make the distinction on what is entertaining movie cosmetics and what is a provocative documentation of something so really it\'s scary . \n'
?,'albert brooks saves the day , just in the nick of time . \nwith a very poor summer for movies , brooks is just what audiences were looking for to cheer them up , and does so in a positive way . \nwhile this may not be his finest work , \" the muse \" still shakes up some delightful humor . \nin albert brook\'s latest comedy , he tells a story of a troubled screenwriter ( brooks ) who\'s losing his edge , as his business partners say . \nin desperation , he goes to see his friend jack ( jeff bridges ) , who has been a very successful screenwriter in the past . \nhe asks jack for some help , and recieves word of a real life muse , that has helped him and many other directors throughout their career . \nso brooks seeks the muse named sarah ( sharon stone ) , and is suckered into buying her expensive , food etc . as a sort of payment . \nthe real punch line however , doesn\'t come until the end . \nit really makes you wonder , how screenwriters really get their ideas , could it simply be from a friend or a bum in the street ? \nthe idea itself is provoking and brooks does it in a hilarious manner . \nspeaking of brooks , he was absolutely hysterical as a screenwriter . \nevery time he graces the screen , i can\'t help but start laughing . \nalbert has a very unique sense of humor that makes him a very likeable character . \nthe real problem with the film lies with sharon stone . \nshe wasn\'t likeable at all . \nbrooks had the right idea with her occupation , but she never pulled through . \nin a way , she drained energy from the once funny atmosphere and left it bleak . \nluckily brooks could clean up the mess , and cover for stone\'s mishap . \nit was a shame that the film went slightly downhill after her appearance , because \" the muse \" had the potential to a be a very authentic comedy . \non a brighter note , andie macdowell was also charming as brook\'s wife . \nshe is always a nice addition as a supporting actress , because she has that charisma that seems to complete the atmosphere to any film she\'s in . \nthe funniest moments in \" the muse \" in my opinion were the cameos by james cameron and martin scorsese . \ni mean imagine , brooks seeing these big named directors in his back yard seeking sharon stone for advice , like it was something out of the ordinary . \nit was just plain hilarious . \nit just adds to the satire joke , of how directors get ideas . \nbrilliant move by brooks . \nas i mentioned before , the film is a satire much like it\'s proceeder bowfinger , which came out a few weeks before . \nunlike bowfinger , this is not a mean spirited film that\'s desperate for jokes , it\'s rather a witty and humorous look at hollywood . \n \" bowfinger \" had it\'s moments , but had quite a few problems that were never worked out , but \" the muse \" still managed to keep the laughs despite a bit of a detour . \nby the end of the film , you\'re glad to see a good hearty comedy come out of it . \nfor once i\'m not fully disappointed , because the film didn\'t slow down , it kept moving , even with some flaws . \nthumbs up to brooks for his brave effort . \ni think he\'ll still manage to keep his edge around well into the future . \n'

?,'pre-review note : seeing as the only concern of body shots is \" sex \" , i will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review . \nbecause of this , i will try to vary word descriptions of \" sex \" ( meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms , and \\ or your name is jerry falwell , you are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen ) , so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot comprehend , fret not , it\'s most likely just another way of referring to \" sex \" . \ni think we\'d all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review . \nthough not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what . \nbody shots is a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously , in the way you\'d normally expect to see a violent attack . \nit\'s about people who think about screwing , seek it out , and talk about it . \nthese are things we all do , sometimes . \nthe characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts . \ntheir lives center around the next sexual encounter , but they seemed depressed . \nit\'s as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek . \nat its core body shots is a message movie , the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition . \nmichael cristoffer ( who directed gia , another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil ) is a moralist with nothing new to say . \nhis characters don\'t communicate anything of interest to each other , so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera . \nthey voice simplistic platitudes like \" i like to come \" or \" sex without love equals violence \" . \nhuh ? \nand yes that is as complex as this movie\'s observations get . \nthe characters are stupid and shallow , with not one registering as anything more . \nthe plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure , then the after math ( the morning after ) of such events . \nwe meet the characters as they speak directly to us , confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy . \ni would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them , giving you the pros and cons , but for this film i cannot . \ni\'m not trying to be clever or witty , but i honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others . \nwith the exception of trent ( played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman ) , the rest fade into each other-- a patchwork of fake breasts , defined abs , pearly white teeth , and creamy , flawless skin . \ni vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one , only because his character gets the worst lines ( \" sex without love equals violence \" ) . \nin between all the confessionals , cristoffer films everything like a headache commercial , with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning . \nthe fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me . \nthis film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims to be defining . \nif body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and f * * k-obsessed , fine , i don\'t have any problem with a film that tries to persuade me to think a certain way , but cristoffer only gives us one side . \nadditionally that one side isn\'t even entertaining ; the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness . \nor realism . \none sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters . \nthey suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason ( other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other ? ? ? alas , if it could only be that easy ? ? ? kidding of course ) , then , not only isn\'t it erotic , it isn\'t real . \nit doesn\'t feel like an authentic sexual encounter . \nevery f * * k scene in this film ( and there are many ) is treated in the same unsexy manner . \nbody shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film . \nit shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it , and most of all , it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it . \nthe resulting search for nookie ( and you can take that cookie ? ? ? ) over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow . \nthe main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred . \nthe film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape ( one where it is consensual the other where it is not ) and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off . \nthis is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently , and if memory serves me i can\'t think of one film that has done so , and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80\'s next to wall street . \nunfortunately nobody gives us reason to care , not the writer , the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off . \npaul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here , though boogie nights succeeded . \nit was similarly moralistic , but it gave us two different viewpoints ; it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters , and it showed us the possible fall-out of such a decision . \nthe characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here , but anderson seemed to care about them . \nhe gave them heart . \ncristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones . \nhe preaches to us , by using his characters to preach to us . \nthis is not the way to get any message across . \nwhy not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of hittin\' skins ? \ncristofer kind of does that , though without an ounce of insight , and with a helping of leering exploitation . \n'
?,'under any other circumstances , i would not be discussing the ending of a film to the extent that i will in this particular review . \nhowever , in order to fully explain exactly how and why this movie is so awful , a minute dissection of the ending is necessary . \neven though i will not reveal the details of the last scenes , do proceed at your own risk . \nthe movie opens ( quite poorly , i might add ) as child psychologist malcolm crowe ( bruce willis , looking like he was dragged out of his trailer at the wee hours of the morning to shoot each scene ) and his wife are intruded upon by one of malcolm\'s past patients . \ndistraught , the suicidal man ( a cameo by new kid on the block donnie wahlberg ) shoots malcolm and then turns the gun on himself . \ncut to the \" next fall \" , as we find the good doctor quietly observing his latest case , a trouble young man named cole ( haley joel osment , one of the only child actors in a while i didn\'t want to bludgeoned over the head with a blunt instrument ) . \nafter about 45 minutes of seemingly unrelated freak occurrences , we learn that cole has \" the sixth sense \" , the gift of being able to communicate with the dead . \nand this , as they say , is where the healing begins . \nthe sixth sense and its unexpected popularity is founded upon a twist ending that i knew going into the film ( one of roger ebert\'s colleges was kind enough to give it away on a recent segment of \" siskel and ebert \" ) . \nalthough i was at first enraged that an established film critic could so callously ruin a film for thousands of patrons , i soon realized that this turn of events could in fact have been a blessing in disguise ; i\'ve always been a sucker for surprise endings ( my favorite movie is the usual suspects ) and rarely dislike a film that sports one . \nhere , since i knew the major plot twist that was coming at the film\'s conclusion , the possibly of being bamboozled into loving a bad movie solely because of its ending ( something i\'ve fallen victim to in the past ) was eliminated . \nand indeed , my viewing of the sixth sense did prove to be quite an enlightening experiment . \nstripped of the element of surprise , the film was put to the task of showing what it really had , instead of simply hiding behind a shocking conclusion . \nafter seeing its true colors , i came to the conclusion that the sixth sense is , despite what the many champions of the movie may say , void of any real power . \nit\'s a neat concept , but not one that justifies being made into a feature-length movie . \nin fact , the sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale that the rest of the film develops as a sort of prelude to the supposedly earth-shattering revelation that is yet to come . \nand when the final moments do come , it\'s a huge letdown ; the end makes no sense at all . \nit stupefied me with the heights of its ineptitude and is completely idiotic on a fundamental and very rare level . \ni won\'t go into any details , but suffice to say that , as far as i can tell , it negates to rest of the movie to such an extent that anyone who buys it even for a second must be suffering from a very acute case of attention deficit disorder . \nnow , in all fairness , i cannot say for sure that i would have guessed the ending ( however stupid it may be ) had it not been revealed to me before hand . \nhowever , i feel very confident that i , as well as anyone who had seen a few \" twilight zone \" episodes , would have seen it coming a mile away . \nthe fact that movie-goers nation wide are surprised by the ending still has me stumped . \nironically , to fully appreciate the best scene ( that of cole and malcolm attending a little girl\'s funeral ) , the viewer is required to be aware of a very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy . \ni wouldn\'t have even known about this mental disease if i hadn\'t , by pure dumb luck , caught \" dateline nbc \" the other week when they did a feature story on it . \ndespite being blessed with some really amazing cinematography and a brauva performance from osment ( where was this kid when casting calls were going out for the phantom menace ? ) , in the end , the sixth sense is too chalk-full of contradictions and just isn\'t plausible enough to warrant even a slight recommendation . \n'
?,'the small-scale film , in limited release , \" waking ned devine \" is a pleasant excursion to a time and place which allows the audience to absorb the full texture of a small town . \nfilled with breathtaking scenery , \'characters\' , and delightful music , the movie would be interesting even without a plot . \nthe story contains several surprises which are best left unmentioned in a review . \nthe film starts out with a sharp opening , which gives us a taste of what is to follow : country folk with an inclination for a bit of larceny . \nwhat gets things going is the fact that a winner of the lottery is apparently one of the residents in the small town ( pop 52 ) of tullymore . \nwho that person is , and how to share in the good fortune is the mission of two longtime friends jackie ( ian bannen ) and michael ( david kelly ) . \npart detectives , part scalawags , they have to stay alert to the changing circumstances they face as the story unfolds . \nthe village consists of several amusing characters . \na clueless pig farmer , temporary priest , and a witch . \nthere\'s also the lotto man who must be satisfied that everything is on the up-and-up . \nthere are no hollywood touches to this film - except for the outer space introduction [ ! ] . \npacing is right . \ntowards the end , it runs a bit out of steam , but that\'s okay because for most of the 90 minutes we\'ve been interested in the goings on . \na mixture of laughs and ( occasional ) sentiment - all the right emotions are engaged . \nin one brief dream sequence - you\'ll know it when you see it - a fantastic combination of color and music transports the characters to a place you really hope exists . \none of the key moments in the film . \nthe music , available on cd ( london 289 460 939-2 ) follows the same arc as the movie and is well worth considering . \na fine film that\'s for everybody except action fans . \nsomewhat like \'the englishman who went up a hill and came down a mountain , \' . . . \nbut livelier . \n'

?,'what a contrast ! \nin the space of two days , i saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly . \ni\'m not sure you could get two more different movies . \nwhile the former was all over the top , telegraphing everything , shoving its philosophy of life down our throats , hurlyburly was the complete opposite , wound so tight and with so much buried in its script , one could spend weeks thinking about it . \nthis is one interesting movie . \nit\'s very much in a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of \'98 , in the company of men , although not quite so nasty . \nthere\'s lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men . \nhurlyburly doens\'t contain much plot : we just follow eddie ( sean penn ) around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him . \nhis big question is : does it all pertain to him ? \nand if it does , how is he supposed to feel about it all ? \n \" it \" means everything : television , friends , events that happen . \ni guess it could be summed up more crudely as : what\'s it all about ? \nthis is not a movie for answers . \ndonna ( anna paquin ) gives some but they\'re not really satisfying : they just lead to more questions . \nthat\'s what makes this movie stay on your mind . \nthese are the sorts of questions that occupy our time . \neven when we push them to the background , however we resolve these questions influences everything we do . \nthe performances are all superb in hurlyburly . \ni haven\'t seen sean penn in much before ( in fact , i can\'t remember seeing him in anything ) , but he is brilliant in this . \neddie isn\'t a likeable character , but sean penn makes him understandable . \ni don\'t want to be his friend but i\'d like to help him . \nchazz palminteri is also great as phil , making him an awful person . \ni\'d never want to know phil but still i understand why eddie wants to be his friend . \neveryone in this film nails their performances , making this world real . \nit\'s a nasty world ; it\'s a sexist world . \nunlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically correct , hurlyburly is a man\'s world , seen unapologetically through the eyes of men . \ni find this fascinating and on two counts , depressing . \nfirst , it\'s depressing that such a world exists . \na large part of hurlyburly\'s success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood ; that there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world , toys , playthings . \nsure , everyone is background to everyone else but in this world , women are a long way in the background . \nsecond , these are the movies that are being made : stories about men\'s world . \nwhere are the stories about women\'s world ? \nnot the soap operas and the \" chick flicks \" that are meant to satisfy women , but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like hurlyburly does for men . \nhurlyburly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the moment the film starts . \nit\'s very talkative , intelligent and static . \nwhile this can make the film drag a bit , and people sometimes sound like they\'re quoting textbooks , mostly this is a good thing . \nnot all films have to be filled with special effects and sweeping panoramas . \nnot all films have to underestimate the intelligence of their audience . \nall it means is that hurlyburly is probably just as effective on video as it is on the large screen . \nit also means that you have to pay attention . \n'
?,'capsule : the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smith\'s films gets their own movie . \nthe gags are sporadically funny . \nit is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti-gay jokes . \nthe plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team . \nthe little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film . \nsadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching . \nthis feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night . \n ( and it turns out he had very good reasons . ) \n , low 0 ( -4 to +4 ) \na film needs a plot . \nit needs characters for empathy value . \nit needs a story and an emotional center . \nif a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are . \nkevin smith has now made two satisfying films , clerks and chasing amy . \nwith dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp . \npeter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled . \nbut getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smith\'s fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it . \nhis remaining two films , mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience . \njay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes , penis jokes , flatulence jokes , film pastiches , and in-jokes . \nhow funny the jokes are will be a subjective call . \nfor me , the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny . \nthere was not enough cleverness or variety . \nit is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay . \npenis jokes work only so many times . \nshowing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags . \nthey were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford , the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british post-war films including dead of night , the lady vanishes , and passport to pimlico . \njay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation x stoners . \nas the series wore on they had larger and larger parts . \nin jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads . \njay and silent bob ( played by jason mewes and kevin smith ) are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks . \nthis leaves them at loose ends . \nthey are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie . \nthey decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash . \nso it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way . \nthe film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood \nthe problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny . \nsilent bob , being silent , can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his . \nthis makes his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have . \njay has to be the comic . \nhe could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive . \nthe problem is that he is not sufficiently funny . \nhe is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair . \nso jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team . \ntheir starring roles and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen before--sometimes just minutes before . \nlike dogma before it , but definitely not like chasing amy , this film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie . \ncertainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving . \nthey are excuses for gags , many of which still fall flat . \nit is dogma without any of the humorous theological content . \nthe film does not offer much to an adult audience . \ni rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n'

?,'the original babe gets my vote as the best family film since the princess bride , and it\'s sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics , both siskel and ebert sighting it more than a month ago as one of the year\'s finest films . \nso , naturally , when i entered the screening room that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be found , this notion left me puzzled . \nit is a rare thing for a children\'s movie to be praised this highly , so wouldn\'t you think that every parent in the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see this supposedly \" magical \" piece of work ? \na tad bewildered , but pleased to not have to worry about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along with family films , i sat back for 97 minutes and watched intently and with a very open mind , having great expectations for the film . \nlooking back , i should have taken the hint and left right when i entered the theater . \nbelieve me ; i wanted to like babe : pig in the city . \nthe plot seemed interesting enough ; after the events that took place in the original , babe the sheep-pig has become a legitimate national phenomenon . \nbut after a fateful encounter with a water well , arthur hogget ( james cromwell , who the movie could have used alot more of ) has been rendered bed-ridden for a number of weeks and the farm begins to go under financially . \nthe only solution that his wife ( magda szubanski , going from delightfully charming to downright annoying ) can come up with is to make an appearance with their new celebrity pet at a national fair ( i think ) and to use the money they earn to pay off the bank ( set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the public ) . \nproblem is , the fair is being held in the middle of the dreaded \" city \" , a completely foreign place to both the pig and his companion . \nsetting the main plot in motion , mrs . hogget and babe travel to the unnamed city and shack up with a sweet lady who just happens to love to help animals , despite the law that you cannot keep them in hotels . \nit is here that we meet an array of eccentric characters , the most memorable being the family of chimps led by steven wright . \nhere is where the film took a wrong turn . \nup until this point , i had being having a rather enjoyable experience . \nthe beginning featured some smart writing and funny situations involving the farm animals from the first one and even an inspired moment at the airport where mrs . hogget is accused of smuggling drugs . \nunfortunately , the story wears thin as we are introduced to a new set of animals that reside at the hotel , none of them being even one-tenth as interesting as the characters from the previous babe . \nthe main topic of discussion surrounding babe : pig in the city is the question of whether or not it is to dark and disturbing for small children , and i believe it is . \nat one point , a dog is hung from his neck and slowly starts to drown . \nat other times , we are treated to surrealistic flash-backs to mrs . hogget\'s full cavity search at the airport . \nin fact , the overall tone of the movie is rather bleak and depressing . \nhowever , that is , as they say , neither here nor there because kids will probably not like the movie anyway . \nthe animal characters and their plights were simply not intriguing enough to sustain my interest for an hour and a half , let alone entertain a child . \nanother problem i found with the film was it\'s sudden change of pacing and tone near the end of the story . \nif you\'re going to make a darker and more sinister sequel , fine . \nit may not be my cup of tea , but at least it is a noble ambition . \nbut to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movie and all of a sudden have slapstick finale with mrs . hogget swinging from wall-to-wall of a ballroom in elastic overalls ? \nit just didn\'t feel right and was more painful to watch than it was funny or entertaining , and the same goes for the rest of the movie . \n'
?,'i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick . \ntake the professional , for example . \nit boasts extremely glossy cinematography , a couple of recognizable name actors , and a couple of fairly impressive explosions . \nit\'s also basically about violence and cheap titilation , and features a central relationship between a middle-aged man and a twelve-year-old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension . \nthe professional is all over the map , and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant . \nthe professional of the title is a new york hit man named leon ( jean reno ) , brutally efficient but also very isolated . \none day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door . \nher name is matilda ( natalie portman ) , and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired d . e . a . \nagent norman stansfield ( gary oldman ) after matilda\'s father tried to rip him off . \nleon reluctantly takes matilda in , then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother . \nthe two become closer , which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much , and sets out to eliminate them both . \nwriter/director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita , a slick potboiler about a female assassin . \nthere is no question that besson can make a great * looking * film ; with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast , he has created a film chock full of moody close-ups and evocative lighting . \nbut beneath the shiny wrapper , there isn\'t nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe . \nthe relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop . \nleon is mostly a collection of quirky traits , all intended to show us that for a hired killer , he\'s really not so bad a guy : he drinks lots of milk , takes meticulous care of a potted plant , and enjoys gene kelly movies . \njean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality , but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda . \nnatalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality , but she doesn\'t have too much to work with , either . \nbesson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life , and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing . \na silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place , as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover ; character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag . \ngary oldman\'s entire part is something of a cheap gag , wild-eyed and way over the top , but at least he is interesting to watch . \nthere isn\'t a real person to be found anywhere in the professional , which isn\'t always a problem in an action thriller , except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more . \na more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelve-year-old in a really distasteful way . \nthere were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matilda\'s relationship : confront it head on , or ignore it entirely . \nbut besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that he\'s going to show them a forbidden love story , while choosing simply to focus his camera on portman\'s rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing . \nthis is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol , or the blood which is spilled aplenty . \na great deal of the time , the professional is just plain sleazy , and all the soft filters in the world can\'t disguise that fact . \n'
?,'making your first feature film ain\'t easy . \nassemble a decent , if not , strong cast , as writer/director robert moresco has done with one eyed king , and you\'re already ahead of the game . \nbut rehash old plot lines , tired dialogue , and standard clich ? s , and a well-intentioned effort such as this one could jeopardize your chance at a second feature film . \nhow many more movies do we need about a rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse ? \nthe enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade a filmmaker from making yet another , but here we have it . \nagain . \nfive irish kids in nyc\'s hell\'s kitchen make an overemotional pact over some stolen rings on an anonymous rooftop . \nwith teary music . \nand slow motion . \nin the film\'s first scene . \nthe kids grow up to be fairly worthless adults , unable or unwilling to make their way out of the heat of the kitchen . \nleading the clueless pack is william baldwin as a good-hearted guy who watches out for his buddies and is in tight with local mob head armand assante . \ni\'d like to say that his character gets involved over his head in some sort of blah , blah , blah , but all we seem to get are little tastes of possible plot points . \nhe\'s concerned about buddy jason gedrick\'s heroin abuse . \nhe sticks up for jim breuer after he impregnates baldwin\'s character\'s sister . \nhe looks into who might be pushing the most moronic-looking counterfeit cash ever made ( a genuinely funny touch ) . \nbut none of this ever really amounts to anything . \nit seems that moresco\'s greater concern is to provide that intangible \" slice of life \" , that flavor of the neighborhood that everyone\'s been trying to evoke since scorsese\'s early work . \nso , we get the drunk guys , hugging and singing together at the local bar , to prove to us that they really love each other . \n ( do people actually do this ! ? ) \nwe get a lot of tough street talk -- usually mumbled for effect -- and a whole lot of the f-word , whether it sounds like it fits or not . \nwe also get a handful of good actors in small roles that seem to lack purpose . \nbruno kirby , chazz palminteri , you know , guys you\'ve seen in movies just like this one before . \nassante is intelligent casting as the man that everyone fears , and baldwin\'s performance is adequate , but most of the rest of the cast jump into the tough guy persona so thoroughly that it\'s almost funny . \nmoresco , a theater guy and sometimes tv writer ( including the series falcone ) , obviously labored over this one as anyone might a first child , but the content is probably too personal . \nas a result , the movie\'s style is heavy-handed , in need of a considerable amount of toning down . \nnearly every time an action by the grown up gang recalls something they did as kids , moresco reminds us -- boy does he remind us . \nwith slow dissolves to the earlier scene , running in slow motion , complete with dialogue from the present , just in case we don\'t comprehend the link to the past . \nmoresco needs to either trust his audience\'s intelligence , or have more faith in his own presentation rather than beat us over the head with it . \nhis next project should have a little more personal distance , and a lot more subtlety . \nif he actually gets that chance . \nreviewed as part of our 2001 boston film festival coverage ( feature story coming soon ) . \n'
?,' \" easely one of the worst films of the year . . \" \nwith the millenium just around the corner , hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century . \nthis time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil . \nthe result is somewhat predictable . \ni didn\'t have high hopes about arnold\'s \" much anticipated \" return to the big screen . \nschwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased , action lovers won\'t be bored , and the catholic league will be angry . \neveryone else will see \'end of days\' for what it is : a deliciously bad motion picture . \nthink of it as hollywood\'s own y2k bug . \ndid you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 you\'ll get 999 , as in 1999 ? \nyes , you better believe it . . satan is here on earth , working on his latest project -- the end of days . \nthis time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and , although not al pacino , he is fun to behold . \nhe coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker , wreaking , as they say , havoc . \nthe way it works is he smirks and something explodes . \nbefore the stroke of the new millennium he\'s got to find and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations . \nonly schwarzenegger\'s cop attached to an anti-terrorist unit can stop him . \nfilms like this has one serious weakness -- logic . \nno matter how you twist the \" plot \" , you\'ll find it incredibly stupid ( even for a schwartzenegger movie ! ) . \nthe incredible fact is that such directors never learn . \nafter thousands of headless productions , this theme has become one big clich ? . \nhere the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution . \nhe is walking around n . y . , blowing everything up and killing everyone that gets in a 5 meter radius . \nall he wants is the girl , that is somehow special . \nbut schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks , he has hidden her in a church , where satan dare not enter . \nso the evil one is forced to seduce the good cop in order to get the valuable information : \" you can have your wife and daughter back . . i \ncan give you happiness that you can only dream of . . just \ngive me the address . . \" \nindeed with a script like that , you could make a wonderful parody , but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously , attempting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller . \nand for you who have awaited arnold swartzenegger\'s comeback , will not be very satisfied . \nwe\'ve not seen him in a while . \nthat\'s because he didn\'t have a worthy opponent . \nhe has battled nuclear terrorists on earth and power mad conspirators on mars . \nhe has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop . \nso , after all those fights , what\'s left for arnold schwarzenegger ? \nhow about satan ? \nin my opinion , he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in cameron\'s \" terminator \" . \nand that is schwartzenegger\'s strength -- muscles and no emotions . \nhere he tries to achieve an artistic level , moving towards the oscar . \nthis is called \" an adult turn \" if successful and \" a flop \" if unsuccessful . \nmake a wild guess ! \nhis character has lost his wife and daughter and has serious drinking problems . \nthis requires at least some acting skills . \nregrettably , the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles . \nthe rest of the cast are struggling with their so called characters . \nthe movie is otherwise technically impressive , with a solid cinematography and fine lighting . \nbut the movie doesn\'t serve neither as a serious thriller ( because of its stupidity ) nor as comic entertainment ( because of its serious tone ) . \nthe only real comic relief in this film is when swartzenegger tries to cry . \nthe action sequences are all recycled and the effects are everything but spectacular . \nso i really have a hard time recommending this film to somebody . \nunless you are a die-hard schwartzenegger fan , stay away . \nas for schwarzenegger , he\'ll be back . \n'
?,'overblown remake of the 1963 robert wise film of the same name ( based on shirley jackson\'s novel \" the haunting of hill house \" ) stars lili taylor as one of three \" lab rats \" that participate in a supposed \" insomnia \" study being initiated by liam neeson . \nhe is actually conducting a study on the causes of fear and why the human mind is still affected by it . \nhe drags the test subjects out to a foreboding mansion where all types of \" creepy \" cgi effects scare the cast and try the audience\'s patience . \ni know this question has been posed before , but why do people keep remaking good movies ? \nthe original was a great psychological horror film . \nthis new version is dull and very decidedly not scary . \nin fact , i feel it is downright impossible to make a modern day pg-13 horror movie that is scary . \nunless you find obvious computer generated special effects frightening , then there\'s nothing in this film that will raise hackles . \ni nearly fell asleep twice during the film , and probably would have if they guy two rows behind me didn\'t seem to have such a personal relationship with the characters that he felt he needed to discuss every decision they made with them as the film progressed . \nit\'s sad to see such an amazing cast wasted so badly . \nowen wilson spends most of the film wandering the halls of the house , and the script does no justice to his wonderful comic ability . \ncatherine zeta-jones ( always nice to look at ) is given the woefully underwritten role of a bi-sexual insomniac that gets to run out of her bedroom perplexed every time some strange noise occurs . \nliam neeson pops in from time to time to talk into his tape recorder and attempt to convince the others that he has as much knowledge about what\'s going on as the rest of them do . \nfinally , poor lili taylor , the center of the film , gets the brunt of the cgi effects thrown at her while everyone else gets to scream and try to rescue her . \napparently , a subplot involving a tryst between zeta-jones and taylor\'s characters was filmed but removed . \nthat\'s too bad , because it might have lent some better characterization to the narrative . \nthis is jan de bont\'s second straight misfire ( speed 2 : cruise control being the first ) . \nwhen is he going to learn that bigger is not always necessarily better ? \nrobert wise knew that when he made the original and the makes of the blair witch project also knew that . \none should not approach a haunted house movie with a twister mindset . \nif de bont and screenwriter david self had let our minds fill in the blanks as to what was happening instead of showing us everything , it would have served to make the film terrifying . \nwhat our mind fashions on it\'s own can be a thousand times more frightening than having having it completely led towards everything . \napparently , yet another version of this story is being filmed under it\'s original title . \ni certainly hope that this newer rendition will not be hurt by the insanity of jan de bont\'s version and that it will retain the psychological impact that the original release had . \n[pg-13] \n'
?,' \" tarzan and the lost city \" is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while . \nnot only it is poorly written , badly acted , and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas , it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid . \nunfortunately , it\'s not bad in the way great , colossal misfires like \" heaven\'s gate \" ( 1980 ) or \" ishtar \" ( 1987 ) were bad . \ninstead , it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with , which begs the question of why it was made in the first place . \nwith all the good scripts lying around hollywood un-produced , how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen ? \nof course , tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history - he has appeared in over forty films , which have ranged from the very good ( 1984\'s \" greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes \" ) down to the really bad ( 1981\'s \" tarzan , the ape man \" with bo derek ) . \nmost of these films were just cheapie b-movies made in the thirties and forties , starring ex-olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps . \ntherefore , if another tarzan movie is to be made , one might assume that it would have something new to offer - a different angle , an original storyline , anything to set it apart from all the others . \n \" greystoke \" added a never-before-seen level of realism to the pulpy tale , and even \" tarzan , the ape man \" at least had the mis-guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek\'s bare breasts . \n \" tarzan and the lost city , \" on the other hand , has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue . \nthe script , by bayard johnson and j . anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come . \ncomic books have better plots than this . \nthe movie is so bad , in fact , that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer\'s comedy \" george of the jungle . \" \ndidn\'t the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs ? \nthe story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established : a quick opening narration tells of tarzan ( casper van dien ) being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes , and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage . \nwhen the movie starts in 1913 , he is a civilized english gentleman ( without an english accent ) , and he is to marry jane ( jane march ) in less than a week . \nhowever , when a wicked archeologist/grave-robber named nigel ravens ( steve waddington ) begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar , one of africa\'s last great secrets , the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle . \nat first , jane refuses to go , pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding ; but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down , therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape-man . \nonce the film gets going ( in its own sluggish way ) , it delves into a series of jungle adventures , as tarzan , jane , and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city . \nmost of the so-called adventures are cheesy , predictable , and unexciting , with no pace , tension , or action to speak of . \nthere are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies , ranging from \" raiders of the lost ark \" ( 1981 ) to \" the goonies \" ( 1985 ) . \nwhen the movie is running short on action , it includes a few greenpeace-friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals , releasing a baby elephant from a trap , and throwing ivory tusks into the river . \nthe movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality . \nfor instance , when tarzan - who was raised in the jungle - is bit by a cobra , he doesn\'t even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi-experienced weekend backpacker would do . \ninstead , he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival . \nof course , one can\'t help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is . \nnot to ruin the ending or anything , but there is no lost city . \nthere is , however , a lost pyramid , which i suppose is all the resource-strapped fx department could come up with ( the special effects are not worthy of a made-for-tv movie ) . \nwhich also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid , when it\'s sitting right out in the middle of an open field ? \nstrictly speaking , \" tarzan and the lost city \" isn\'t even bad enough to have camp quality , although casper van dien\'s laughably stiff performance comes real close . \nthis movie proves what \" starship troopers \" only hinted at : he cannot act , but he sure looks well-groomed , even in the deepest heart of the african jungle . \nvan dien is much too much of a pretty-boy to be an effective tarzan ; he\'s a calvin klein model in a loin cloth . \ni also wondered what the make-up department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa-1983 steve perry haircut . \nwaddington makes a decent villain , although he\'s like a charmless version of belloq from \" raiders of the lost ark . \" as jane , the ex-model jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan . \nshe does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two , but whenever a snake comes into the picture , she is reduced to a hysterical mess . \nhowever , amidst all this complaining , i do have one piece of good news . \n \" tarzan and the lost city \" is so lacking in ideas both new and old , that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid . \nso , we can say this much for it : at least it had the decency to be short . \n'

?,'seen december 2 , 1997 at 6 : 50 p . m . at the glenwood movieplex cinemas ( oneida , ny ) , theater #3 , by myself for free ( free pass ) . \n[theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture] \nthere are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons . \nthey provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context , from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation . \nwatching \" flubber \" really clinched this idea for me , because it\'s just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy . \nit proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality , and how important it is to actually have a story . \nthe film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted , cartoony atmosphere . \nwe meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard ( williams ) , the typical , supposedly likable mad scientist . \nwithin the first 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is . \nphillip\'s memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag and more like a real case of alzhiemer\'s disease - isn\'t this rather lowbrow comedy ? \nhe starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing class ( an inappropriate joke for a kids\' movie if i ever saw one ) . \nwe learn he has stood his up fiancee , sara ( harden ) , twice at the altar simply because he\'s forgotten . \nsara claims to love him , but says if he forgets the wedding again she\'ll stop loving him ( a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has ) . \nbut even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve , and it\'s no surprise the major conflicts here are related . \nchristopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft , a scientist who not only wants to steal phillip\'s ideas , but his woman too . \nwhat\'s worse is that sara actually seems interested in him ! \nwilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield , which is going broke , unless phillip can invent something to save the day . \none of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film . \nthe flubber is played for gags after it is introduced , but is all but forgotten about thereafter . \nit\'s obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber , a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy , and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny . \nunfortunately , the flubber , like all the special effects in this film , looks very fake and unconvincing . \nflubber also seems to have intelligence and a personality , and by the time it performs a song and dance routine , you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object . \nmost of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy ( since phillip\'s absent-mindedness is forgotten about ) and somehow push the story along . \nbut it\'s clear how weak this premise is from the get-go and the film just gets worse . \nall the jokes involve people getting hit by fast-moving , flubber-powered objects including : bowling balls ; flying cars that don\'t fly well ; and a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air . \nit\'s all presented with complete logic , and no one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes . \nduring the basketball scene , the coach for the rival team actually says , \" i think they might be cheating , \" to which the referee replies , \" there\'s no rules about jumping too high . \" \n \" predictable \" doesn\'t begin to describe the motions the film goes through , especially after the halfway point . \nand it\'s not how terribly contrived the plot is , it\'s the way it\'s broken down scene-by-scene , with absolutely no transition . \nnot only that , but all the actors here , especially williams , seem bored to tears . \ni\'d say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen , so it\'s almost forgivable when you realize they\'re talking to nothing and interacting with nothing . \nit\'s safe to say everything that could be bad about \" flubber \" is . \nthe only original element the film has is the world\'s first romance between a machine and a human . \nbut this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it , and , like the rest of the film , you won\'t . \n'
?,'director doug ellin\'s kissing a fool , released earlier this year , is an aptly titled comedy about two plastic couples housed in an artificial story . \nlike a sitcom with jokes so lame that it would be impossible to overlay a laugh track on it , the movie meanders along insulting the viewers\' intelligence in almost every frame . \nthe script by james frey and the director is filled with vapid actors who read meaningless lines you\'ve heard before . \n ( \" i\'m not wearing any underwear , \" the bimbo tells the famous sportscaster , max , in what she assumes will be a sure-fire come-on line . ) \nmax , chicago\'s biggest playboy , decides to get married after a whirlwind love affair with sam , short for samantha . \nmax and sam possess two irritating personalities , and they hold little chemistry for each other or the audience . \nmax is played without any style by david schwimmer . \nschwimmer , whose acting talent is playing characters devoid of personality , makes an unlikely lover . \nhis costar , mili avital as sam , is cut from the same cloth , so they can be argued to be a matched pair . \nafter all , people of the same intelligence are naturally drawn to each other , ditto for similar looks , so why shouldn\'t the personality-challenged be attracted ? \nthe implausible plot has max asking his best friend , jay ( jason lee ) , to hit on sam as a test . \njay is supposed to try to get her to sleep with him , but stop short of the actual act . \nmax , being promiscuous by nature , worries that his future bride may have the same need to sleep around as he does . \nthe idea of flirting with the beautiful sam makes jay so sick that he becomes unable to eat or work . \nneither the script nor the actors make this test believable . \n \" the 64 , 000 question is : how do you know you\'re with the wrong person so you can avoid wreaking havoc on major parts of your life ? \" \njay asks in one of the unsuccessful attempts at adding some seriousness to the film . \nfinally , there is the film\'s attempt at physical comedy . \njay\'s ex-girlfriend natasha ( vanessa angel ) becomes infatuated with jay again once she thinks he is going out with someone else . \nnatasha rips jay\'s shirt open after pushing him down onto the sofa . \nas she throws her hair on his bare chest , she demands he pull it . \nthis is supposed to be funny ? \nmost films have some saving grace . \nsome bit part was done especially well or some scene managed to be funny even if the rest of the picture wasn\'t . \nkissing a fool , on the other hand , has nothing to recommend it . \nkissing a fool runs 1 : 45 . \nit is rated r for profanity and sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers . \n'

?,'all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos , please raise your hands . \nthank you for identifying yourselves ; now would you all please go away . \nyour influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade , and it shows no sign of abating any time soon . \nit isn\'t just the strobe light quality of your twenty-cuts-per-minute editing , or the numbing over-use of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised \" featuring the music of . . . \" no , it is a kind of cynicism you have perfected , banking on the idea that no one will care about the lack of a story if you include enough bells and whistles . \nwelcome to the club , scott kalvert . \nyour adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and one-dimensional , serving only as the vehicle for a performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as a whole . \ndicaprio stars as jim carroll , the new york poet/songwriter/ performer on whose autobiographical writings the film is based . \nas the film opens , jim is a budding high school basketball star given to petty thievery and getting drunk with buddies mickey ( mark wahlberg ) , pedro ( james madio ) and neutron ( patrick mcgaw ) . \none night , jim graduates from inhalants to cocaine , and shortly thereafter to heroin . \njim\'s addiction to the drug starts him on a downhill spiral , as he is kicked off the basketball team by his coach ( bruno kirby ) , kicked out of his home by his mother ( lorraine bracco ) , and drops out of school . \nalong with mickey and pedro , jim becomes a victim of the street , living from fix to fix and sinking lower and lower . \nthe basketball diaries has been bouncing around as a project for years , but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as a character was too unsympathetic and too much a loner . \nscreenwriter bryan goluboff created the three characters who act as carroll\'s posse , resulting in a jim carroll who is just as unsympathetic , but now with equally unsympathetic friends . \nas a film , the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale , a 100 minute long \" just say no \" public service announcement , but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie . \njim is sort of a jerk even before he becomes a junkie , but i suppose that his pseudo-sensitive poetry and his devotion to his terminally ill friend are intended to balance that out . \nperhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those \" good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd \" that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be ; i saw him simply as part of the bad crowd . \nwithout a character who changes in any appreciable way , the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into a collection of crimes committed by jim and his strung-out cohorts , all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack . \ndirector scott kalvert doesn\'t have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work , so he substitutes silly slow-motion photography , self-consciously funky camera angles and choppy editing . \non only one occasion , when a steady pan around a room where jim is trying to detox makes it appear that the walls are closing in , are any of the gimmicks effective . \nmostly , they just draw attention to how hollow the story is . \nthey also don\'t allow leonardo dicaprio\'s performance to be as strong as it could have been . \nfor every impressive moment , like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money , there is a scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics . \ndicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors , particularly a fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an ex-junkie who tries to help jim straighten out , but kalvert won\'t let character interaction define this story . \nhe wants to turn dicaprio into a rock star , shooting him in dramatic fashion but denying him the opportunity to do much acting . \nat isolate moments , the basketball diaries is a fine showcase for dicaprio\'s talents . \nfar more frequently , it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what a long form velvet underground video might have looked like . \n'
?,'i went to blair witch project 2 : book of shadows with the highest of hopes . \nthe original film , released last summer , was genuinely scary and terrifying ; i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor . \nunfortunately , my hopes were soon dashed . \nas the movie opens , the audience is shown pseudo-documentary clips of burkittsville , maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie . \nit\'s a mostly humorous , self-aware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film . \nduring this segment , we are introduced to the protagonist , a young man who sells blair witch-related memorabilia from his website . \nthe movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously . \nwe see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia , but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies . \nwe see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette-smoking doctor luridly leers above him . \nwe see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room ; we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him . \nno explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution ; in fact , these scenes are barely referred to again . \ni had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes ; generally , a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting , filthy interiors , and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie . \nthe movie cuts again , this time to the present . \nthe young man , whose name is jeffrey ( played by jeffrey donovan -- as in the first movie , the character names are identical to the actors\' names , although this movie admits up front that it is fictional , so there\'s no reason for the practice this time around ) , is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the \" blair witch hunt , \" which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website . \nwe meet tristen and steven , a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience . \nsteven is a skeptic , believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria . \ntristen , on the other hand , believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence . \nshe is wan and soft-spoken ; she complains that the radio is playing too loudly . \n ( she also complains that she feels nauseated ; i knew immediately that the character was pregnant , and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out . \nhow did i know ? \nbecause in bad movies , nauseated women are always pregnant . ) \nthe fourth member of their party is erica , a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch , not evil . \nthey pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery . \nkim is dressed completely in black , has extreme goth-style makeup on , and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities , but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch . \npresumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect ; it\'s never explained . \nthe party of five heads off into the woods as promised . \nthey reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr\'s house and set up camp , complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night\'s events . \nthere is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well , but after a few words are exchanged , the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere . \nthe movie veers off at this point to spend many long , long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down . \nsexual innuendoes are tossed around , much hard liquor , beer , and pot is consumed , and nothing much else happens . \nthis would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary . \nthe next day , the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed , and that steven and tristen\'s manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds , like snow . \nthe videotapes are missing , but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim , they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house , \" right where the original blair witch tapes were found ! \" \nooh . \nspooky . \nthe team goes back to jeffrey\'s house -- a creepy old civil war-era warehouse in the heart of the woods -- to regroup and review the tapes . \nthey soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night . \nwacky hijinks ensue . \ntristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch , everybody starts finding these weird rune-like burn marks on their bodies , steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations , and everything pretty much goes to hell in a handbasket . \nthroughout the entire ordeal , jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes , which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps ; eventually tristen wanders in , mutters something about \" reverse , \" and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards . \nwhen they do this , they discover what really happened during the five lost hours . \n ( one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes . \nokay , if the videotapes were being buried , then how were they recording themselves . . . oh , \nnevermind . ) \nthis movie was awful . \nsimply awful . \nthe characters are broadly-drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development . \nerica is the nature-loving wiccan . \ntristen is the weak and sympathetic woman . \nsteven is the overbearing asshole . \nkim is the antisocial goth girl . \nold , tired cliches were used to illustrate these caricatures . \nhow do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic ?

?,'a cinematic version of one of john irving\'s novels is always cause for celebration even if , as in the case of \" simon birch , \" the treatment is merely \" suggested by , \" rather than strictly based on , the book . \nsuggested means that irving , author of the acclaimed \" the world according to garp , \" sold the rights to his novel \" a prayer for owen meany \" to the disney machine for $1 million , but wouldn\'t grant them permission to use either the title or any of the character names . \nthat\'s an odd decision--irving claims it\'s to protect both himself and the novel--but it\'s one that doesn\'t unduly harm the finished product . \nirving\'s books are rich and complex works , full of intriguing , colorful characters . \n \" a prayer for owen meany \" is no exception ; it tells the story of an unusual boy--called simon birch in the film version--who is uncommonly small in stature and possesses a high-pitched falsetto voice , \" like strangled mice . \" \nsimon believes himself to be \" god\'s instrument , \" placed on this earth to somehow effect god\'s plan . \nsimon is played by ian michael smith , who suffers from a rare enzyme disorder known as morquio syndrome which , among other things , prevents bones , ligaments , and joints from developing normally . \nsmith\'s debilitating disease makes him an obvious physical choice for \" simon birch \" ; however , the producers unwisely favored form over function--smith\'s acting abilities are limited at best . \nanother drawback is that in the book , simon\'s condition is described the way irving describes any of his characters--in careful , loving detail . \nwatching \" simon birch , \" however , creates a different feeling altogether ; the audience is forced into a voyeuristic relationship with the character , surely something irving would not have intended . \nsimon himself tends to be too cute and irritating , a combination of smith\'s rookie status as an actor and the precocious one-liners he\'s forced to deliver , courtesy mark steven johnson , the film\'s director and screenwriter . \nfortunately , simon birch isn\'t the real star of the film that bears his name . \nsimon is more of a catalyst , allowing his co-stars to shape the story , and the actors who fill those roles to turn in outstanding supporting performances , saving the film from an obsequious , manipulative destiny . \nfirst and foremost is joseph mazzello ( \" jurassic park \" ) , who is nothing less than remarkable as simon\'s best friend , joe . \nmazzello turns in a wonderfully layered performance for a 14 year old , ripe with laughter , pain , and tears ; he is certainly an emerging talent . \nashley judd positively beams in her role as rebecca , joe\'s single mother , and oliver platt is warm and tender as her boyfriend , ben . \ndavid strathairn and jan hooks play the town\'s reverend and sunday school teacher respectively and their contributions uphold the high standards set by the others . \nthere\'s even a surprising yet effective uncredited cameo performance from . . . \nwell , that would be telling . \nperhaps \" suggested by \" the novel is the appropriate way to go after all , since \" simon birch \" only focuses on one chapter , one year , of simon\'s extraordinary life . \nthe film also changes the book\'s ending to one that is more melodramatic , yet necessary given simon\'s lot . \nthe flavor of irving\'s original novel remains , however--the passions , friendships , and insecurities that come with a change of seasons to the little community of gravestown , maine , and the engaging oddballs , both big and small , who reside there . \n'

?,'you know something , christmas is not about presents . \nit\'s about over-hyped holiday films with lots of merchandising and product tie-ins . \nat least that would seem to be the message of \" the grinch , \" which has been advertised since last christmas and whose logo is currently plastered all over stores . \nhollywood expects us to ignore this cynical greed as the movie scolds us about losing the true spirit of the season . \nyou know the plot : there\'s this evil furry green guy called the grinch ( jim carrey ) who lives on a mountain overlooking whoville . \ndown below all the whos are preparing for their whobilation , but the grinch is determined to steal their christmas . \nthe movie is , of course , a live-action version of the beloved children\'s book , which was previously adapted into a 1966 tv special by looney tunes animator chuck jones . \nit\'s rare that a big budget hollywood release is shamed by a thirty-year-old half-hour cartoon , but that\'s the case when jones\' version is compared to ron howard\'s . \nthe tv grinch hit all the right notes : boris karloff\'s soft , deep narration ; thurl ravenscroft singing \" mr . grinch \" ; max the dog weighed down by the gigantic antler tied to his head ; and the grinch\'s wide , toothless grin . \nby contrast , the movie hits one sour note after another . \nfirst , there are the numerous bad choices that jeffrey price and peter seaman made in padding out the short book into a 105-minute movie . \nyoung wide-eyed cindy lou who ( taylor momsen ) is depressed about the misplaced priorities of her parents ( bill irwin and molly shannon ) during the holiday season . \nshe begins to sympathize with the grinch , who turns out to be surprisingly sympathetic . \ncindy lou discovers that the grinch turned tearfully away from whoville in grammar school when he was publicly humiliated while expressing his love for the prettiest girl in the class , martha may whovier ( played as an adult by christine baranski ) . \nare we expected to like the grinch , hate the whos , and want him to steal christmas ? \nthe grinch isn\'t even the villain here ; that role is filled by the corrupt mayor of whoville ( jeffrey tambor ) who was the grinch\'s rival for martha\'s affection . \nnot only are the characters needlessly complex , but the once-simple plot becomes so convoluted that the actual theft of christmas seems like an afterthought . \nthe casting choices aren\'t any better than the screenwriting decisions . \njim carrey seems woefully miscast . \nwhile his face is so supple that the rubber make-up seems superfluous , carrey brings nothing else to the role . \nhis accent keeps changing ; i assume he was shooting for karloff , but he ends up sounding like a weird slurry of richard nixon , sean connery , and cartman from \" south park . \" \nnot knowing what else to do during his many scenes alone in the grinch\'s home , carrey falls back on his stand-up comedy and clowns around ace ventura-style . \nneedless to say , his wise-cracking antics don\'t quite fit the character of the grinch , who is an embittered loner filled with hate . \nlittle taylor momsen brings little to role of cindy lou except big eyes and a cute smile . \nshe would have been fine if cindy lou was limited to her original purpose in the seuss story ( finding \" santa \" in her living room stealing the tree ) . \nhowever , the expanded script makes cindy as important as the grinch , and momsen is not up to the challenge . \nbottom line : when you\'re stealing christmas ( movies ) , leave this one behind . \n'
?,'in the mid-1980s , following the splendid debut in hugh hudson\'s greystoke and relative success of first highlander film , it looked like christopher lambert\'s acting career might go somewhere . \nbut , it wasn\'t meant to be , which became obvious following highlander ii . \nin this decade christopher lambert became associated with films with low budgets and even lower quality . \nvery often such films were science fiction , which meant that the fans of that genre learned the hard way what to evade anything starring christopher lambert . \nwhether it was because of real lack of talent , terrible miscasting or simple bad luck isn\'t important - the end result was almost always horrible . \nthe same can be said for fortress , 1993 science fiction film directed by stuart gordon , director who created cult following with his 1980s horror gorefests like reanimator and from beyond . \nthe movie is set in 2018 . \nfor some undisclosed reason , usa introduced strict population control and couples are barred from having more than one child . \njake ( christopher lambert ) and karen brennick ( lori laughlin ) broke that law and are caught by authorities on the border . \nsentenced to 31 years in prison , they are both thrown into fortress , privately owned correctional facility , equiped with state-of-the-art futuristic technology and run by computer called zed . \nalthough equiped with gismos that regulate every aspect of inmates\' lives and make any escape impossible , prison authorities often use violence . \njake survives many ordeals and earns respect of some inmates which would help him when he begins planing the escape . \nsuch escape should become necessity , because the warden poe ( kurtwood smith ) begins showing unhealthy interest in karen . \nafter rather intriguing beginning and some interesting special effects that depict the futuristic settings of prison , this film soon starts sinking into mediocrity . \nthe reason is in the screenplay that quickly degenerates into whole series of prison movie clich ? s and situations that are painfully predictable . \nby the time brennick begins his escape from fortress , those situations not only begin to look predictable , but utterly implausible too . \nof course , film never tried to explain why the country that lacks resources to support its present population happens to spend bucketloads of money on ultra-expensive supertechnology with sole intention of keeping alive most useless and dangerous members of the society . \nthe initially interesting plot is done even more wrong by stereotyped characters , played by not too interested or talented actors . \nlori laughlin , although physically attractive , shows the acting ability of sequoia . \nkurtwood smith as prison warden is rather uninspired , capable of solid , yet forgettable performance . \nlambert\'s performance is also good , but even the bigger talent couldn\'t help this film , destined to end in oblivion . \n'

note to self : kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film ) . \ni don\'t think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan . \nwell , it does contain this element , but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements ( and seemingly more interesting ones at that ) . \nthe devil\'s advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session . \nkevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is the defense attorney , working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl . \nhe ends up with a not-guilty verdict , despite an emotional testimony from the victim ( heather matarazzo ) . \nhe leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann ( charlize theron ) where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury . \nhe accepts ( mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive ) and he flies to new york with his wife . \nafter proving his worth for selecting juries ( and his perfect winning streak in court ) , the head of the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) , asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer . \nhe graciously accepts , where he is treated almost as a god . \nhe is given an incredible apartment ( which is bigger than my entire house now ) , and a hefty paycheck . \nhis life seems to be on the rise . \nand of course , his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline . \nhe is attracted to fellow employee christabella ( connie nielson ) , and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment . \nmary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice , especially if it is not wanted . \nmeanwhile , kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen ( craig t . nelson ) who apparently murdered three people . \nhe spends hours upon hours with this case , while forgetting his loving wife , who may or may not be going insane . \nall of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself . \nafter a while , things turn completely upside-down , as kevin\'s wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends . \na fellow employee is murdered in the park , and his mother ( judith ivey ) reveals information about kevin\'s real father . \nis it all just a big nightmare ? \nor is john milton really satan , playing tricks with kevin\'s life ? \nthe devil\'s advocate plays out fairly straight-forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don\'t expect . \nis this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed ? \nif so , the devil\'s advocate messes up completely , and ironically , i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now , than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early . \ni went into the devil\'s advocate expecting a shocking horror film , and that is exactly what i got . \ni was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally , and that is what i got . \nbut what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending ( did i mention that i didn\'t like the ending ? ) . \nthe producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending , they pull the rug out from under you . \nfilms like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected , more or less . \nwe know it is going to end in an unpredictable way . \nthe devil\'s advocate , on the other hand , ends unpredictably , not from us knowing a lot , but knowing nothing at all . \nif that is confusing , i recommend watching the film , and then reading that again . \nas for the film overall , i enjoyed the entire first two hours , being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study . \nthe film runs like a well-built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that ) . \nand then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur . \nit was at this point that i felt cheated . \ntaking us on a terror ride of intrigue , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiece of the film . \neverything occurs from his perspective . \nhe is our representation on screen ( sort of ) . \nbut we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game . \ni don\'t want to spoil the ending , so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself . \nperhaps the most shocking thing about the devil\'s advocate is the extreme amount of everything . \nit earned its r rating for a reason . \nthere is plenty of nudity , sex , violence , gore , and then you have gore , violence , sex , and more nudity . \nthis film really isn\'t subtle about anything , showing us everything . \nit actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc-17 rating , as it is quite harsh . \nhowever , the movie does have its merits , and nudity and sex are among those . \ni don\'t condone sex and nudity in films , but if its there , i might as well enjoy it . \nthe biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch . \nthe confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining , but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife , mary ann . \nportrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron , mary ann\'s problems are incredibly intense , and i found myself wanting to witness her decline . \nthis may sound uncaring , but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her . \nshe is the most interesting character on the screen , who is forced into a world where she is not wanted . \nsomething the devil\'s advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity , especially for a film of this nature . \nthe story actually has something to say about humanity . \nin one of the last scenes , john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children ( he is satan , of course ) . \nhe comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity . \nthen , god sets up rules which contradict human nature . \nthis semi-religious bashing is more humorous than frightening . \nwhat milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud , partially thinking it was funny , but patially realizing it was true . \nthese moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil\'s advocate , giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing ( but i\'m sure they came straight from the novel it was based on ) . \nwhen a film has something to say about our society , it deserves to be watched . \nthe cast of the devil\'s advocate is one of the highlights , as we see memorable faces , and they put spins on those memorable faces we don\'t expect . \nheather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case , and she does a great job . \nprobably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves . \nhe has proven himself an uneven actor ( successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic ) , but he tops himself with this performance . \ni have never seen him more believable to date . \nal pacino is of course the scene stealer . \nhis devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) . \nhe could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes , but he remains completely believable ( if that is the correct term ) . \njeffrey jones ( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller\'s day off ) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon . \njudith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin\'s past . \nconnie nielson is very effective in her role , and she also appears naked several times . \none familiar face with a twist was \" coach \" star , craig t . nelson , who gives a very good performance . \nthe devil\'s advocate is rated r for sexuality , nudity , violence , language , and some gore . \nat 144 minutes , this film moves along fairly quickly . \nfor the first two hours , i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters . \nthe technical quality is also remarkable , with great special effects and a good musical score . \ndirector taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture , only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes . \ni guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film , and hackford gave me just that for a long time . \nbut just before the end , he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream . \npersonally , i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early . \n'
?,'a number of critics have decided that it\'s open season on freddie prize jr . , slamming the young actor as an utterly talentless pretty boy on career cruise control in sound-alike , disposable teen fluff like \" head over heels , \" \" boys and girls , \" \" down to you \" and \" she\'s all that . \" \nwhile the prinze oeuvre is hard to defend , his talent is not . \ni first saw him in the independent dark comedy \" the house of yes , \" where he gave a subtle , impressive performance as the younger brother in one of america\'s freakiest families . \nprinze has the acting chops ; he just needs to take a few supporting roles in some grown-up movies to show the non-believers that he has what it takes . \n \" summer catch \" certainly won\'t help his case . \ninoffensive , but utterly generic , the baseball-related romantic comedy does little more than kill time . \nthe story deals with the love affair between tenley ( jessica biel ) , a wealthy cape cod girl and ryan ( prinze ) , a local boy from a working class family who dreams of becoming a big-time baseball star . \nryan\'s preoccupation with his new honey-bunny drives her elitist father ( bruce davison ) crazy and endangers his position as pitcher with a cape cod summer league team . \nit\'s a wonder the kid has any time to pitch , as his time is occupied with making out with tenley , fighting with her dad , bonding with his own dad ( fred ward , who deserves better than this ) , fighting with his brother ( jason gedrick ) and carousing at a neighborhood bar with his teammates . \nthe filmmakers desperately want to make a quirky , character-heavy baseball movie like \" bull durham , \" but haven\'t got a clue how to get there . \nand so they glide from one clich ? to the next for 108 minutes . \nthe only bit of originality comes from marc blucas in a minor role as a center-fielder from texas . \nin an early barroom scene , blucas , best known as demon-fighting riley finn from \" buffy the vampire slayer , \" hears a young woman compliment a guy on his ass , then turns to teammate matthew lillard and states , \" he does have a nice ass . \na bubble butt . \" \nwhen lillard gives him an \" are you insane ? \" \nlook , blucas calmly says , \" it\'s nothing sexual , \" then goes on to evaluate the hind-ends of some other players , including lillard\'s . \nspeaking of asses , prinze does not bare his in the movie . \nthe actor has a no nudity clause in his contract , so two stunt-butts were employed for a couple of semi-nude shots . \nblucas , whose character secretly dates a large woman throughout the story , gets another unique moment late in the film . \nsick of hearing teammates make \" fat chick \" jokes , he climbs on top of a table and loudly declares his love of amply-sized ladies . \nwhile his speech still ends up objectifying women , it remains a nice change of pace in a numbingly ordinary movie . \ntrivial tidbit : \" summer catch \" marks a scooby doo summit . \nmarc blucas appears in \" jay and silent bob strike back \" as fred from the scooby doo gang , while freddie prinze jr . plays the same character in the upcoming big budget film version of the old cartoon . \n'

\" \ni asked . \n \" why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine-gun rapidity ? \" \n \" why aren\'t these characters being developed before their adventures ? \" \n \" why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film ? \" \nthese were just some of my questions early on . \nlater , i asked , \" where\'s the magic of the first three films ? \" \nand \" why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes ? \' \nby the end of the film , i was tired , maddened , and depressed . \ngeorge lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless , mindless , summer blockbuster . \nthe phantom menace is no star wars film . \ntake away the title and the jedi talk and the force , and you\'re left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time . \nit\'s an embarrassment . \ni looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored , or a new theme is examined , or a special effects shot isn\'t used . \nthere are a few of each , but they\'re all token attempts . \nthe fact is , george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects . \nthis is not what i wanted to see . \ni didn\'t want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth , but i did . \nthe story centers mostly around qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson , looking lost and confused ) and his apprentice , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor , who scarcely has a line in the film ) and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo . \nnaboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation ; their contact on naboo is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people . \nafter picking up jar jar binks ( a completely cgi character , voiced by ahmed best ) , they head to tatooine , where they meet young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his mother ( pernilla august ) . \nqui-gon knows that the force is strong with young anakin , and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys . \nthe bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious , neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters . \nthere isn\'t anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form . \nthe way lucas has handled it , however , it unsatisfactory . \nfirst of all , we don\'t learn one single thing about qui-gon jinn . \nnot one thing . \nwhat was his life like before this film ? \nwell , i imagine he didn\'t have one . \nthat\'s why he feels like a plot device . \nthis probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role , and why he\'s recently retired from film ( i don\'t blame him , honestly ) . \nobi-wan , a character i was really looking forward to learning more about , is even less interesting . \nmcgregor has just a few lines , so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere . \nsince these two men are the focus of the phantom menace , lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie . \nthings start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine ; young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed-out character in the film , and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role . \ni was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene ; rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting . \nand when anakin says goodbye to his mother , i found it moving . \nalso fairly good is portman , and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has been written . \njar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters i\'ve ever had to endure , but he\'s more interesting than most of the humans . \nas soon as the relatively-brief segment on tatooine is over , it\'s back to the mind-numbing special effects and depthless action scenes . \ni\'ve seen many movies that qualify as \" special effects extravaganzas , \" but the phantom menace is the first one i\'ve seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie . \nthe reason is obvious : george lucas has no restraint . \ni can\'t say that i didn\'t find the effects original , because i did -- the final battle between darth maul , obi-wan , and qui-gon is visually exceptional , as is most of the film . \nbut i also found the effects deadening and tiresome . \nmy breaking point was near the end of the picture , as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters ; in the background , we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky , and i wanted that to go away . \ncan\'t we have one stinking scene that isn\'t bursting at the seems with a special effects shot ? \ni got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours . \nand then there\'s the question of magic . \nwhat was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi ? \ni have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel . \njohn williams\' familiar score is no help , nor is lucas\' direction . \ni think it comes right down to characters : there are none here . \ni longed for the magnetic presence of han , luke , and leia , but i got no such thing . \nand what about the ridiculous expectations ? \nmine weren\'t that high ; i simply wanted a film that showed me the roots of the films that i grew up loving , a story that had a few characters and a few great special effects . \ninstead , i got two hours and fifteen minutes of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show . \ni don\'t hate the phantom menace as much as i resent it : i\'d like to forget that it exists , and yet i can\'t . \nit\'s here to stay . \ni can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them , because if they don\'t , then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series . \n'
?,'the lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories and possible futures is a fascinating topic . \nfinding an all-star cast for such a film is a stroke of genius . \ncombining all that with a three-time oscar-winning director ( robert benton of \" kramer vs . \nkramer \" ) and creating a decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment . \nin yet another noir mystery set in hollywood -- how many of these have we seen during the past few years ? \n-- the atmosphere is moody , the actors enjoyable to watch and the story goes nowhere . \nover-70 harry ross ( paul newman ) is a washed up cop-turned-private eye-turned man friday trying to figure out how to live what remains of his life . \nhe\'s screwed up things pretty well ( \" i had a wife and daughter . \nnow , i\'m a drunk ) and is at a crossroads . \na couple of years ago , he traveled to mexico to bring back mel ( reese witherspoon ) , the under-age daughter of jack ( gene hackman ) and catherine ( susan sarandon ) ames and now lives with them . \nthe ames are former movie stars , past their prime and the three have become fast friends . \none gets the impression that ross is just hanging out waiting for something to wake him up . \nto fill his time , he does odd jobs for jack and falls in love with catherine . \njack is in even worse shape than harry . \nhe\'s dying of cancer with only a year to live . \nthings do turn more exciting when jack asks harry to drop off a sealed manila envelope for him . \ninstead of the routine errand that ross expects , he walks into a barrage of bullets from the gun of another ex-cop who is , himself , full of bloody holes . \nthis unsettling event gives the former detective a project to throw himself into and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherine\'s first husband 20 years before . \nthrough a series of very complex and convoluted plot devices that involve murder ; blackmail ; guns ; mel\'s mexico traveling partner and his parole officer ; ross\'s former cop buddies , ex-lover and would-be sidekick , the tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it to . \nit\'s a film noir tradition that the story twists and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale , but here the journey meanders towards an ending that no one cares about . \nthe only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role in the scenario . \nby the time they show you , it doesn\'t matter . \nthe storyline gets goofier and goofier exemplified in ross\'s relationship with rubin ( giancarlo esposito ) , a partner wannabe . \nthese scenes are obviously designed to be comic relief , however they are neither . \nrubin and ross have some past relationship but either it\'s not explained or i didn\'t care enough at that point to remember . \na running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico is probably meant to mirror his questions about whether he is still able to perform . \nit\'s also not funny , doesn\'t connect and keeps on showing up long after it has run its course . \non the positive side , it\'s often enjoyable to watch the seasoned actors on the screen . \nthe three leads all have well-deserved academy awards and turn in accomplished , if not extraordinary jobs . \nnewman is a grand actor , but doesn\'t seem quite suited to the dark film style . \nhe is a bit too clean and understated to come across as desperate and down and out . \nhackman , also low-key , is believable but lacks sparkle . \nsarandon comes across well as an sultry older babe although she is one-dimensional . \nthe actors do what they can with lame dialog , but they can\'t pull the film out of the hole it\'s dug for itself . \njames garner who plays ross\'s old buddy ex-cop raymond hope is always a treat , but even he half-heartedly struggles through lines like \" i\'m glad they didn\'t shoot your pecker off . \" \nthe best part of the film is the look at old friends , how their relationships change over the years and the difficult choices they must make . \nthe genuinely easy and casual interactions among the actors hint that being on the set was much more interesting than what ended up on the screen \nthe film doesn\'t run very long before the audience realizes that it\'s hopeless . \nthe only reason for watching is the actors . \nit reminds me of disaster movies such as \" towering inferno \" where the star power is supposed to make everyone ignore the film\'s problems . \nin a better world , there would have been second-rate actors in this second-rate movie and the ones here would have been saved for something better . \nof course , we don\'t live in that better world , but you could make yours a little nicer by choosing a different movie . \n'

?,'star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace ( 1999 ) \nreview by matt pusateri \nfew movies evoke nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas\' 1977 classic , star wars . \nthe original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture . \narguably , more americans today can explain what \" the force \" or a \" jedi \" is than a budget deficit or a serb . \nso 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ? \ncan a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ? \nagainst this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week . \nand despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment . \nwhile the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking . \nit is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films . \nthe phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films . \nas the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) . \nthe republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation . \nthe jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations , but in the middle of a planetary invasion , rushing to protect naboo\'s young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) . \nlater , after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo , they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle-damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice . \non tatooine , qui-gon discovers a young slave boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) , who not only can help them get the parts they need , but displays uncanny intelligence , insight , and instincts . \nqui-gon senses the child is \" unusually strong \" with the force and begins to suspect that he may be \" the one \" prophesized to \" bring balance to the force . \" \nas anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows , far from being a galactic savior , the innocent-looking 9-year-old will in time become the ruthless darth vader . \ncomplicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo , and sends out a lethal apprentice , darth maul , to find and capture queen amidala . \nwhile amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul . \nif the plot sounds a bit complicated , it is . \nthe phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin\'s turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy . \nbut the complexity is not overwhelming . \nthe story moves quickly , with the only drawback being that many questions , predictably , remain unanswered at the end of the film , setting the stage for the next episode . \none of the reasons the film\'s story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing , but too unfocused . \nit\'s unclear whose story phantom menace is . \nin the original trilogy , the movies were clearly luke\'s story , with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight . \nbut it\'s unclear whether this new film is anakin\'s story or obi-wan\'s . \nif this trilogy is centered on anakin , it\'s a shaky foundation . \nlloyd , like many child actors , lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers , and as a result , his character seems shallow and unimpressive . \non screen , we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , any presence that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is willing to believe he is \" the one . \" \nthe rest of the cast does fine , though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas . \nneeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight . \nmcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility . \nportman fits the role of a young queen well , but her lines were often very formal , giving her little room to give her character much personality . \nthe biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters , but the interaction between them . \nindividually , the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars , and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series . \nbut unlike the previous trilogy , lucas doesn\'t do as good of a job playing the characters off one another . \nin star wars , there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han , han and obi-wan , and leia and luke . \nthe ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities . \nin the sequence in where luke , han , and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star , the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other . \nthere is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other . \nindividually , they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests , but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them . \nthis is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film , and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers . \nbut despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction , the film is still very engaging . \nmany of the wonderful elements of lucas\' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining . \nfirst , of course , is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates . \nthe characters visit magical underwater cities , evade dinosaur-sized sea monsters , fight battle droids and menacing \" destroyers \" on venetian-looking planet of naboo , watch a spectacular event , part roman-chariot race , part nascar circuit , on the arid desert planet of tatooine , then head to corsucant , the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council . \neach location is elaborate and complex . \nlucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings , he creates rich , spectacular landscapes , palaces , and skylines . \nmost of the new special effects in his re-released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren\'t possible when the films were made . \nmore than ever , in this new film , lucas\' universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures , robots with personalities , and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters . \nthe best such character is watto , a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves . \nwatto has a scratchy italian voice and a short , paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room . \nof all the computer-generated characters in the film , watto is the best done and most enjoyable . \nspeaking of computer-generated characters , no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film : jar jar binks . \nwith more than 80 minutes of screen time , jar jar is the realization of george lucas\' dream to include a fully computer-generated character into the cast of the new trilogy . \njar jar , a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race , literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon\'s accidental sidekick . \njar jar usually performs a comic-relief role in the film , lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble . \nthe animation of jar jar is nearly seamless , and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors . \nhowever , despite the technological magic that makes his character possible , jar jar isn\'t completely convincing . \nhe still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene . \nthroughout the movie , jar jar never transcends a \" roger rabbit \" -like presence . \nyou accept that he\'s there , but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character . \ninitially , i found jar jar annoying , but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film . \non my second viewing of the film , jar jar was a lot of fun and i didn\'t mind him at all . \na second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates . \ndespite all the film\'s struggles between good and evil , and the sober musings about one\'s destiny and \" the force , \" like all star wars films , the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously . \nfortunately , lucas hasn\'t lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment , not high art . \nfrom the bumbling jar jar , to a one-man , two-headed announcer team calling the action at the film\'s thrilling pod-race sequence , to a cameo appearance by e . t . \nin the film , the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun , with lots of half-hidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed . \nand finally , the phantom menace works because , as in all his films , there is no shortage of speed and action . \nfrom beginning to end , there are light-saber battles , hair-raising chases , and thrilling duels between good and evil . \nthe pod-race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film , and the final showdown between obi-wan , qui-gon , and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed , most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed . \nthe phantom menace won\'t win any major oscars . \nit probably won\'t beat titanic\'s box office record . \nand it\'s not even the best star wars film ( i\'d put it third , after the original and the empire strikes back ) . \nbut it\'s an exciting and entertaining film , far better than your typical summer blockbuster . \nthe film can\'t live up to it\'s hype - no film , not even the original star wars , could have done that . \nbut it\'s still worth seeing . . . \nprobably more than once . \n'
?,'any movie about the underground music scene is a difficult beast to master . \nany meaning found in the underground is usually lost by the dumbing-down of the experience to make it \" more accessible \" to the general public . \nor the film is produced and directed by people that have about enough understanding of the subject matter that they ought to work as production assistants for vh1 . \nhuman traffic , a new film exploring the british underground party/rave scene and the people immersed in the world of clubbing , pubbing , drugs , sex , and the beautiful , beautiful music , is an example of how it really ought to be done . \nthe film follows five brits in their young twenties during a wild weekend of parties , drugs , dancing , sex , pop culture discussions , relationships , and wanking off in front of a mirror while mum interrupts . \nthe cast of character consists of jip ( john simm ) , our narrator , who has a bit of a problem with his willy , known as mr . floppy . \nkoop ( shaun parkes ) , our black dj maestro , who has insecurity issues , afraid his girlfriend nina ( nicola reynolds ) is shagging other men . \nnina herself can\'t stand her mcjob and longs for the freedom of the weekends . \nlulu ( lorraine pilkington ) , jip\'s best mate , is tired of her cheating boyfriends . \nand moff ( danny dyer ) can\'t seem to escape the black hole of his awful life . \nthe film follows these five individuals during one weekend as each of them discovers love , friendship , and self-fulfillment , all against the raging party background . \nhuman traffic is proof that cinema can still tell us deep stories while being visually alive , as director justin kerrigan\'s subtle use of the camera lets the audience become part of the action . \nthe use of direct communication to the audience by the collection of characters works well , making the viewer the subconscious mind for the characters . \ndialogue is crisp and moves with an even pace , and the acting is confident . \nhowever , the two females leads tend to promote their relationships and dialogue with a bit of unneeded urgency that shows through when poignancy is needed . \nhuman traffic does not try to explain the rave scene . \ninstead , it gives the audience the ability to listen to the people inside it , letting you choose your own convictions about this powerful musical movement that brings together strangers , friends , and lovers for one blissful night of music and peace . \n'
?,'steve martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking a few years back ; he spent this time writing essays and short stories for \" the new yorker , \" several of which wound up in his hilarious hardback compilation , pure drivel ( 1998 ) . \nmuch of the book spares tinseltown from mockery , although he does riff on the racist comments made by marlon brando during a larry king interview , in a fine chapter called \" in search of the wily filipino . \" \nnow , as writer and star of bowfinger , he offers the masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue a career in the cinema , perhaps finally venting the frustrations ( \'everything being made now is crap\' ) that led to his brief retirement from hollywood . \nmartin stars as bobby bowfinger , a roger corman-wannabe on the cusp of fifty and desperate for some success as a producer , quality of the projects be damned . \nhis accountant ( adam alexi-malle ) proposes a movie called \" chubby rain , \" about aliens who travel to earth in raindrops slightly fatter than regular raindrops . \nbowfinger latches onto the idea immediately , and convinces his troupe of actor friends to appear in the film , based on the lie that america\'s top box office draw , kit ramsey ( murphy ) , has agreed to star . \nramsey , of course , wants nothing to do with such low-grade material , so bowfinger , on the thinking that action stars need to run , not speak , decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously . \nhe sends his cast members ( who aren\'t in on it , either ; they are told ramsey hates the sight of cameras and fraternizing with his co-stars ) to ramsey\'s table at restaurants , asks them to follow him in parking lots , etc . , spouting script dialogue , all the while shooting the outcome from a great distance . \nthe paranoid ramsey flees the scene nearly every time . \nramsey is a member of mind head , a cultish self-help organization apparently dedicated to recruiting celebrities . \n ( as if that\'s not familiar enough , mind head guru terry stricter ( terence stamp ) has been dressed and combed to resemble l . ron hubbard , founder of scientology . ) \nwhen he goes to mind head with tales of caucasian strangers appearing from nowhere to babble \" white code \" in his face , they fear the nervous breakdown of an important client and rush him off to a retreat , requiring bowfinger to find a stand-in . \nmurphy will probably win more fans as jiff , ramsey\'s adorable , ignoramus double , than as kit , but it is his portrayal of the latter that took courage . \nalways surrounded by an entourage , suffering from a racial inferiority complex , murphy plays right into the tabloid image of himself . \nfurthermore , consider the enemies he\'ll make of popular scientologists . \npacing stricter\'s neutral-coloured office as if on an amphetamine binge and stripped of his bigshot veneer , ramsey is asked to shout inane personal affirmations repeatedly . \nmurphy\'s scenes with stamp are exactly what i imagine of a john travolta \" clearing . \" \nnot that murphy is entirely responsible for this schtick ; bowfinger is steve martin\'s invention . \nhis script is surprisingly clever as satire , given that the pseudo-religion is a sitting duck , as is the entire los angeles film industry . \n ( the griffin mill-types take quite a beating , in the form of robert downey jr . as bigwig jerry renfro . ) \nmartin\'s decision to tell the story from a bottom feeder\'s point of view is what keeps it fresh and innovative-never have we seen on screen a group of people struggle this hard to complete a motion picture . \nas expected , there are laughs only to be had insiders or buffs , such as martin\'s crew of mexican border-jumpers , who gain unexpected appreciation for the classics from reading \" cahiers du cinema , \" or martin\'s nonsensical explanation to dave , his loyal cinematographer ( jamie kennedy ) , that every movie , in the end , has a budget of two-thousand dollars ( ! ) . \nmost of bowfinger is universally funny , however ; i defy any viewer to keep a straight face when christine baranski , one of our brightest comediennes , is on screen . \nbowfinger\'s main flaw is a plot twist that has an insubstantial aftermath . \nwe\'re also asked to believe that a few simple close-ups of kit ramsey would redeem \" chubby rain , \" z-grade entertainment that would make ed wood blush . \n ( this aspect of bowfinger has much in common with the ludicrous oscar sequence in oz\'s last directorial effort , the poorly conceived in & out . ) \nthese are significant enough weaknesses that they distracted from my enjoyment of the piece . \nas i mentioned at the start of this review , bowfinger offers solid reasons not to do what heather graham\'s character daisy does : hop a bus to hollywood in search of stardom . \nthat said , it offers one fantastic reason to get on that bus : the sense of community between filmmakers who gel is awesome . \nmartin gets sentimental by story\'s end as he did in l . a . story , and how could he not ? \nfor those who can hack it , the movies might be the greatest business in the world . \n'
?,'`bats\' is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan . \nto pull something like this off , you need to have a sense of wit and style , with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines . \nsomething like the underground worm thriller `tremors\' had just the perfect mixture of these elements , and in return , the film was tremendous fun . \nwith the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player , `bats\' mainly plays it\'s premise for straight-arrow horror . \njudging by the ridiculous premise , this was not exactly a wise move . \nthe movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcock\'s `the birds\' , but fails miserably . \ndone right , it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema . \nunfortunately , `bats\' is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly , terribly wrong . \nthe only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be . \ni will recite the following paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom `bats\' is aimed toward . \nthose guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats . \nthese bats are not very nice , because they eat a lot of people . \nboy , are these bats ugly . \nthey are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super-duper smart . \nthey\'ve got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all . \na whole bunch of people in texas get killed , so a sheriff guy and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats . \nthey have big guns and other cool things to fight them with , but the bats are pretty smart , so it\'s sorta hard to do . \nthe bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good . \nbut no , `bats\' is probably too violent for pre-schoolers . \nthe film , directed by louis morneau , should have ventured straight into video stores . \non the small screen , perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations . \nbut sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward ; although at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure , the film is poorly written , poorly acted and executed with glaring ineptitude . \neven the bats themselves are cheesy , and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed . \nthe sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey ( lou diamond phillips ) , who embodies every pathetic stereotype a small-town authority figure usually portrays ( he chomps on a cigar , struts contentedly in his boots , etc . . . ) . \nthe scientist is dr . sheila casper ( dina meyer ) , who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as `the best in her field\' . \nmeyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable , but everything about dr . casper is recycled beyond recognition . \nher memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hooper\'s tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in `jaws\' . \neverything revolving around `bats\' is tired drivel , which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up . \nthe supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw , with voices dubbed in later . \nin fact , that may have worked out better in the end . \ntake one glance at casper\'s bat-loathing sidekick jimmy ( leon ) , and you\'ll have immediate deja vu - he\'s the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie , constructed specifically for timed comic relief . \nunfortunately , none of his comic interludes are funny . \nin the role of deranged mad scientist dr . mccabe , the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch . \nmccabe `accidentally\' released two experimental test subjects , and the virus spread to other bats . \nthe entire town of gallup , texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures , but gunton appears to be inconspicuously contemplating something else . \nsomething like : `when is the damn movie going to be over ? ? \ni just want my money . \' \nthe bats are ugly , i must say . \nthere\'s the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing , but mainly , the swarm is represented in cheesy digital imagery . \nonly bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have been , but by the absurdly stupid climax , it\'s way too late in the game for a decent recovery . \ncharacters experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire . \nlet\'s explore the logic there : is this really a very efficient way to decrease the bat population ? ? \nyou could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents and not even wound one , and after that there are only 18 , 000 more of them . \nthis kind of behavior represents the regular level of intelligence behind `bats\' . \n'
?,'>from the man who presented us with henry : the portrait of a serial killer ( 6 . 5/10 ) \ncomes a wild tale set within the elite and white trash of florida\'s south coast . \nplot : guidance counselor ( dillon ) is accused of raping one of his students . \nshe happens to be the daughter of one of the wealthiest women in florida . \nthe counselor is brought to court on the charges , as another white trash girl ( campbell ) , also joins the rape finger-pointing club . \nas the story unfolds , we find that many things aren\'t exactly as they seem ( that\'s as much as i could say without ruining anything ) . \ncritique : good little flick that slows down at certain points , and runs a tad long , but generates enough twists and turns to keep most people interested throughout . \nmind you , i could see many people not liking it because it takes \" one too many \" twists and turns , but hey , i happen to like that kind of thing . \nand besides , the twists and turns in this movie managed to remain within the realm of believability ( or scathingly close to ) , and even \" explained \" many of its turns with a showcase of missed scenes during the credit crawl at the end of the film ( do not leave the theatre before you see the credits . . . it \nreally does clear up some stuff ! ! ) . \nother than that , the acting was good , with campbell transforming her \" good girl stereotypical \" role into a pot-smoking , goth-looking white trash chick out for a good time . \ndenise richards ( from starship troopers ( 7/10 ) fame ) solidifies herself as hollywood\'s jelly-donut pinup girl of the moment , and proves that all breast implants needn\'t lead to lawsuits . \nbacon is solid , and so is dillon ( while continuing to prove his inability to age to the whole wide wondering world ! ! ) . \nsprinkle the story with a bunch o\' shots of alligators peeking through the swamp waters , bacon showing the world the size of his ding-dong ( do we really need to see this ? ? ) , a couple of lesbian kissing scenes , and a menage-a-trois , and you\'ve got yourself a decent time at the movie theatre . \non the down side , the soundtrack was not as prominent ( or slick ) as i thought it would be , and theresa russell ( real name : theresa paup ) seems to have lost her way in every which way possible . . . . ooooh , \ni almost forgot bill murray\'s exquisite role as the down-trodden lawyer who agrees to defend dillon in court . \nmurray actually added that extra little spice of humour that allowed this film to affirm its position as a quirky little noirish tale of sex , greed and mystery . \nlittle known facts : neve campbell specified a non-nudity clause in her contract ( she\'s also born in guelph , ontario . . . go \nhoser ! ) \ndirector john mcnaughton says he deleted a scene that would have shown matt dillon and kevin bacon showering together , as it was gratuitous . \nkevin bacon plays in a band with his brother , called the bacon brothers , is married to actress kyra sedgwick , and has a game based on him called \" six degrees of kevin bacon \" . \n'
?,'director dominic sena ( who made the highly underrated kalifornia ) and producer jerry bruckheimer ( the rock , armageddon ) bring us a slick and entertaining remake of the 1974 film of the same name that absolutely no one has ever seen . \nnicolas cage plays memphis , a retired car thief who\'s \" pulled back in \" to the business by an evil car thief overlord ( christopher eccleston ) determined to kill memphis\' kid brother ( giovanni ribisi ) . \nmemphis is ordered to steal 50 cars in four days time or his brother will meet an unfortunate demise , all while having to elude the detectives hot on his trail and a rival car thief who feels the job should have been given to him and his gang . \nmemphis sets out to put his old crew back together , but discovers that most of them have retired as well . \ngone in sixty seconds does things right from the opening credits . \nin that sequence , we get a rockin\' little tune from moby , along with some simple back story told only with photographs and assorted objects . \nfilmmakers can sometimes make or break a film just from its opening title sequence , and this one easily gets you in the mindset for an entertaining ride . \nand what follows doesn\'t disappoint . . . \ncage turns in one of his good performances here ( he can easily go either way . . . \ngood or bad . . . \ni don\'t know how he does that ) , and his mannerisms and dialogue delivery carry the film along nicely . \nof the supporting cast members , angelina jolie as memphis\' former love is in the film just to provide eye candy ( she\'s definitely the hottest looking grease monkey i\'ve ever seen ) and robert duvall as memphis\' former mentor is just around to lend the film some class . \nalso , i\'m a big fan of will patton ( armageddon , the postman ) and would love to see him get a huge role someday . \nnone of these three performers are given much to do unfortunately . \nsome underrated performers however are given meaty supporting roles . \ndelroy lindo ( get shorty ) shines as the exasperated detective in pursuit of memphis , as does timothy olyphant ( go ) as lindo\'s partner . \ni just wish some of the other characters could have been as important . \nthe only real gripe i have about the film though is its conclusion . . . \nmainly because you know how it will end before the opening credits even roll . \nthere\'s no doubt in anyone\'s mind that the 50 cars will be successfully stolen , and the filmmakers blew a perfectly good opportunity to add some suspense to the picture by using the \" rival car thief \" plot line . \nas it stands , that story line is wrapped up about halfway through the film in a tidy little package . \nbut if i was making this film , i\'d have had the rival gang trying to get to the cars before memphis and his crew , thereby making memphis have to improvise . . . \nthereby adding some meat to the plot . \nthe finale is essentially just a big car chase , and there just aren\'t ways to make car chases interesting anymore . \nit\'s all been done . \nthe chase is also shot and edited in that \" jerry bruckheimer action sequence \" kind of way that leaves the audience wondering what specifically is going on in the scene . \nsure it\'s a car chase , but what exactly are the particulars of it ? \nit\'s very hard to tell . \nfinally , there\'s a stunt during this scene that comes close to challenging the \" bus jumping the ramp \" sequence from speed in the \" oh , i don\'t think so . . . \" \ndepartment . \ndespite those minor complaints , gone in sixty seconds is pure summer movie entertainment . \nit\'s not thought provoking , but it\'s shiny , loud and fun . . . \njust what a summer flick should be . \n[pg-13] \n'
?,'a new entry in the \" revisionist history \" genre of filmmaking , dick suggests that two not-too-bright teenage girls are the cause of the uncovering of the nation\'s biggest presidential scandal . \nkirsten dunst and michelle williams star betsy and arlene , who while trying to deliver a fan letter from arlene\'s watergate hotel room , accidentally stumble across g . gordon liddy ( played dead-on by harry shearer ) and the infamous break-in . \nwhen they recognize liddy later on during a white house field trip , they are ushered into a conference room , questioned as to what they know , and leave as official presidential dog walkers . \nthe girls manage to unwittingly uncover every bit of the watergate scandal while performing their duties , but have no clue as to what they are getting involved with . \nwhen they discover that nixon ( another dead-on performance by dan hedaya , who actually favors nixon slightly , unlike anthony hopkins ) has been abusive to checkers , the presidential dog , thanks to the conversations that he always recorded , they quit and become disillusioned . \nduring a prank phone call the girls make to woodward and bernstein , events are set into motion that eventually lead to the president\'s resignation . \nthis film starts off promisingly with an aged woodward and bernstein arguing with each other on an obvious larry king-type talk show ( featuring a cameo by french stewart ) about revealing the identity of \" deep throat \" . \nfrom there , we are subjected to bodily function humor and just about every bad \" dick \" joke one can derive from this type of supposed comedy . \nat one point , the girls are having to scream over a high school band playing on the steps of the lincoln memorial . \nthe band manages to stop right as dunst screams \" you have to stop letting dick run your life ! \" \nmuch to the horror of everyone standing within earshot . \nseveral other variations on this wordplay surface all throughout the film . \nif this movie had been smarter i would have been less likely to fault it\'s juvenile bathroom humor , but it\'s not . \nthe film was apparently made for relatively younger people because every major player in the watergate scandal is introduced and shoved down the audience\'s throat in the least subtle way possible . \ni don\'t recall oliver stone\'s nixon having to pander to it\'s audience , but of course that film wasn\'t a comedy aimed squarely at a 13-20 year-old film going audience . \nthe only redeeming thing about this movie is it\'s remarkable supporting cast . \ni wanted to see more of ferrell and mcculloch\'s woodward and bernstein . \nthose two characters are the sole basis for my rating . \ni wish they had been given more screen time , but unfortunately , they are only relegated to the final half-hour . \ntheir constant bickering and fighting over trying to get the story are a major highlight , especially mcculloch\'s constant thwarting of ferrell\'s attempts to gather information from the girls ( who , in the course of the narrative are revealed as deep throat , so named thanks to an ill planned trip to a porno theater by betsy\'s brother ) . \nthe other members of the cast are excellent in their portrayals of their particular characters , but are given nothing to work with . \ni\'d like to see the same cast portray these characters in a script more suited towards their comedic abilities . \nas for the two leads , dunst and williams can definitely do better . \nthey come off as what could best be described as romy and michele : the early years in this particular film , a highly dubious distinction at best . \nstay through the first half of the end credits though , to see an interesting scene involving dunst and williams suggestively sucking on lollipops emblazoned with the title of the movie . \nan excellent idea marred by poor execution , dick could have been a great movie . \nless of the juvenile humor and more of the smarter comedy displayed by the woodward and bernstein scenes , could have made this film a wonderful satire of the nixon presidency as seen through the eyes of two naive fifteen year olds . \nas it stands though , dick offers nothing but what filmmaker kevin smith so accurately defines as \" dick and poopie \" jokes . \nand that , to me , does not make a funny movie . \n[pg-13] \n'

?,'is it just me , or have disney films gradually lost their appeal ? \ni was almost stunned by the quality of \" who framed roger rabbit ? \" , a fun , unique look at a world where cartoons and people lived together . \n \" the little mermaid \" harkened back to , and perhaps surpassed , the classic disney animations from the first half of the century . \nhowever , the endless stream of \" the little mermaid \" wanna-be\'s is getting to me . \nyou know the spiel : a lame plot recycled from some well-known story , colorful , almost psychedelic animation , the lead character who learns a valuable moral lesson , the comedic sidekick/sidekicks , the seemingly unattainable love interest , a few catchy songs , a few in-jokes for adults , and the occasional out of place warner-brothers-coyote-fall-off-the-cliff type joke . \nit\'s a formula , and like any formula , it gets tiresome . \nthat\'s why i\'m delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution rights to the works of ghibli , a japanese cartoon studio . \nfrom what i\'ve seen of their movies ( \" kiki\'s delivery service \" and the already english-dubbed and american- distributed \" my neighbor totoro \" ) , foreign audiences are in for a treat . \nthese movies , particularly \" kiki\'s delivery service , \" are wonderfully original and entertaining . \n \" kiki\'s delivery service \" starts with an unusual premise : kiki , upon hearing forecasts of clear skies , decides it is time for her to leave home . \nthis is unusual because kiki isn\'t a college student or a young adult making her start on the world , but a thirteen year old girl eager to begin her training as a witch . \nher mother is also a witch , and as thirteen is the obligatory age for such training , her parents treat her leaving understandingly and put up only token resistance . \njust the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audiences , but no mention is made of the occult , and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie : kiki\'s mother acts as a village doctor , and kiki is able to do no more than fly on a broom . \nkiki must choose a city to move to , and what she chooses is the co-star of the movie : a german seaport town , far removed from the country life she has been used to . \ninitially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding , she\'s discouraged , and unable to support herself though her rudimentary skills as a witch . \non the verge of leaving for a new town , she uses her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it . \nthe favor eventually blossoms into her working as a courier , a one-persons delivery service . \nthis is where the movie becomes shockingly good . \nkiki\'s job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her . \nthe townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesn\'t seem forced or artificial , but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in a different light . \nthey\'re three- dimensional , impossible to quickly evaluate , possessing of faults , and understandably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl . \nhowever , each one has something about them , some interest or trait , that makes them interesting and unique . \nthe personal beauty of the citizens is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings : the seaport town genuinely looks impressive , capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern needs of the 1950\'s . \nthis beauty is beauty with depth ; for every detail left in , dozens are only hinted at . \ni could probably go on all day , but i won\'t ; suffice it to say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie . \nsome of my favorites are kiki\'s relationship with the baker\'s husband : although he\'s quiet , never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movie , and he initially scares her , his kindness wins her friendship . \nin the garage of a deliveree\'s house can be found a vintage model t . two old ladies have a relationship evolving from master-servant to friend-friend . \nsuch details gives the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg . \nadded on top of this is a lesson on the importance of self-worth . \nkiki initially seems to derive much of her self-worth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her , but an encounter with a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment , making her question the importance of such beauty . \nthis causes kiki to lose faith in herself . \nhowever , kiki comes to realize not only the beauty of her surroundings , but the innate beauty inside her . \nseeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous , and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that i don\'t even want to hint at it . \nthe ending of the movie has a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe and , ironically , the most disney-esque moment i\'ve ever seen ; if you don\'t hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention . \nthe movie steers free of many of the disney conventions : there is no violence , however cartoonish , no song-and-dance number , and kiki\'s pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick , although jiji is given many funny lines and scenes . \nhowever , i would be surprised if disney doesn\'t give jiji more jokes , or at least the voice of some comedian . \nrefreshingly enough , the moral lesson of the movie is not self-contradicted , a habit disney movies have gotten into . \n \" beauty and the beast \" \'s beautiful belle , for instance , learned that beauty was derived from a person\'s inside , and was then rewarded by having the beast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing . \nkiki , on the other hand , learns to separate her wardrobe from her self-image , and nothing more is made of her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the film . \nanother difference with disney movies is in the style of animation for \" kiki\'s delivery service \" : not as colorful and dynamic as disney animation can be , but with a greater attention to realism and detail , it fits the movie to a t . this is particularly true with scenes of kiki\'s flights . \nthe extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold , and helps these scenes capture the wonder of flight better than any other film i\'ve ever seen . \ni\'m not sure when or how this movie will be released in the united states . \ndisney tentatively plans a theater release of \" monoko hime \" shortly following the summer \'97 japanese release , and should start releasing the other ghibli films after that . \ni\'d guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak seasons with no competing disney release . \nalthough the wait is unfortunate , it\'s good to know that it\'s being released at all , for \" kiki\'s delivery service \" is definitely a movie worthy of widespread promotion and release . \nwatch this movie . \nalong with \" man bites dog , \" and perhaps something by woody allen , this is the best movie i\'ve ever seen . \n'

suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence . \nthey\'re pleasant enough to watch , and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists aren\'t . \nthen it gradually becomes clear that there\'s virtually nothing to loser but scenes of that sort . \nin theory , loser is a romantic comedy , but there is scarcely a laugh to be found in the entire film ( notable exception : a cameo by a scene-stealing comic actor as a video store clerk ) . \ninstead of taking any time to make the characters\' situations funny , heckerling spends 98 minutes making her characters\' situations pathetic . \nshe shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless , nor any of that film\'s interest in lively plotting ( not surprisingly , since clueless\'s plot came via jane austen\'s emma ) . \nshe simply turns the film into a pity party . \nsince loser is a film composed almost entirely of establishing character , you might think that those characters would be interesting , or at least slightly complicated . \ninstead , you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that there\'s no reason to watch them . \npaul isn\'t just a nice guy , he\'s flawless ; consequently , he\'s a central character who does absolutely no growing . \nhis roommates aren\'t just inconsiderate , they\'re actively evil-blackmailing professor alcott , drugging women with rohypnol and generally giving humanity a bad name . \nand professor alcott isn\'t just manipulative , he turns dora into his house slave . \ndora\'s unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in loser , and even that isn\'t explored in sufficient detail . \nthere\'s more ambiguity in the 30-second snippet from alan cumming\'s broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret then there is in the rest of loser it\'s one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations ; it\'s another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush . \nand it would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow . . . \ni don\'t know . . . \ncomic . \nstill , i spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser from its tedium and justify my desire to like paul and dora . \nthat hope dissolved the moment heckerling underscored a sequence of paul in the throes of unrequited love to simon and garfunkel\'s \" scarborough fair/canticle . \" \ninstead of giving the sequence a knowing wink-a reference to the graduate , a hint that paul is becoming an overly-sensitive clich-heckerling plays it deadly straight . \neven in the scenes that scream for a light comic touch and a bit of a poke at her protagonist\'s foibles , she finds it impossible to stray from the gospel of paul as saint . \nclueless\'s cher had her self-absorption and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness . \nin loser , amy heckerling shows a leaden hand with material that demands friskiness ( her one show of wit involves naming paul\'s dorm \" hunt\'s hall \" after erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall ) . \nher gift with casting proved to be her curse . \nloser may be a crashing bore , but gee , aren\'t those two kids swell ? \n'
?,'the \" disney stick-to-what-you-do-best \" rule states that disney\'s animated features will invariably be sublime but whenever they try their hand at live-action kids\' entertainment , they will fail miserably . \nthis goes double for occasions when they try to make a live-action adaptation of a popular cartoon ( remember the 1996 version of 101 dalmations ? \ni\'m still trying to forget ) . \nthat rule proves more dependable than ever with inspector gadget , an insulting , despicable and , worst of all , expensive piece of trash trying to pass itself off as a viable children\'s film . \nit will bore anyone over five and should prove unbearable for adults , even at its relatively skinny running time of 80 minutes . \nit\'s films like this that make me want to go to my local blockbuster and rent something from the days when brains were more important than budgets and wit compensated for lack of fancy effects . \njust as matthew broderick began to convince me that there is hope for him as an actor yet , his career takes a nosedive to hell with his \" role \" as john brown , a depressed security guard with a big heart who hopes that one day he can become a real policemen and help the people around him . \nhe dreams of heroic deeds and the subsequent admiration of his long time crush , dr . brenda bradford ( joely fisher ) . \nbut after a few bizarre coincidences it seems that he has to dream no longer . \njohn breaks every bone in his body while trying to save dr . brenda\'s father . \ndr . brenda has been working on a \" gadget project , \" which would make a half-man half-machine super-policeman to fight crime . \nfeeling indebted to john she decides to save his life by making him the subject , realizing his dream of becoming a policeman . \nnow , when he says \" go go gadget [insert name of gizmo here] \" he can use all kinds of nifty gadgets to capture crooks , bang up bandits and mangle murderers . \nin the meantime , the evil claw ( rupert everett ) , the man responsible for the murder of the good doctor\'s father is building a gadget of his own : a carbon copy of our inspector gadget except evil and john brown\'s worst nemesis . \nclaw has plans of world domination , which leaves it up to the inspector and his gadget mobile ( voice of d . l . \nhughley ) to save humanity from his wrath . \nstate of the art effects fly at a mad pace in this $90 million dollar movie and yet director david kelogg never sets up a convincing atmosphere . \nhad they replaced all the fancy gizmos with dollar bills they would have wound up with the same effect . \nwhat we see on the screen is like the raw ingredients of a meal : all of the expensive f/x amounts to nothing . \npart of the charm of the tv series was its sly irreverence which has gone down the toilet in the condescending movie . \ncan kids really admire a hero so goody-two-shoes that he screams \" hey ! \nyou ran a stop sign ! \" \nwhile hanging off the back bumper of a quickly moving vehicle ? \ni think that today\'s children will respond better to somebody dashing , someone ultra-cool . \nthey ( probably ) receive enough preaching from their parents and its an insult to their intelligence to assume that they want to go to an action movie to see a father figure kick butt . \nin addition to the more complex complaints above , there\'s also the simple stuff : inspector gadget is boring , formulaic and achingly implausible . \nthere\'s no feeling that the director really cares about his story : more than any other film i\'ve seen this year , this one really feels like it was made on an assembly line . \nthere\'s a popular commercial ( for sprite , but that\'s irrelevant ) running in movie theaters before features that spoofs the way major studios deal with projects . \nit consists of studio suits discussing a fictitious ( thank god ) movie called \" death slug \" . \neach executive gleefully presents a different merchandise tie-in ( slug taco ! \nslug on a stick ! ) . \nat the end one of them asks \" what about the movie ? \" \nanother answers : \" well , we don\'t have a script yet , but we can bang one out by friday . \" \nthey probably could have replaced \" death slug \" with inspector gadget . \nthis film contains the sort of logical contradictions and blatantly obvious adherence to formula that could have been eliminated had any attention been payed to the script . \nit\'s no coincidence that most good children\'s entertainment these days comes from animation . \nanimated features take so long to maker that it becomes a labor of love for the filmmakers and they put care and pride into their work . \nthese kinds of films are banged out quicker and a good percentage turn out worthless , sloppy and impersonal . \nthe studios are becoming factories and films their assembled products . \n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \n'

?,'martin scorsese\'s films used to intimidate me . \nbecause of his reputation , i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks . \nas much as i enjoyed them , i usually felt like i missed something . \ni learned from scorsese\'s casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story . \nno mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies . \nfor example , in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other . \nthere was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on . \nor toward the end , when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building . \nagain , the simple , mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing . \ni don\'t mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good-looking . \nbut he simply uses the best tool for the job . \nit shouldn\'t have surprised me , then , that kundun , a film about a mystical religion , actually turned out to be quite straightforward . \nthe movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama , the spiritual and political leader of tibet . \nthe movie\'s title is another name for the dalai lama which means \" ocean of wisdom . \" \nhis story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story . \n ( one of which makes an interesting statement : pay attention to the film\'s opening shot and watch where it is repeated . ) \nwe first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old . \nhis curiosity and self-assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama . \na test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before . \nseveral items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items . \nthe child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own . \nthe boy picks correctly , proving that he is the new , and the old , dalai lama . \nscorsese and long-time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk . \nbefore selecting an item , he would look at the monk , perhaps for some sort of confirmation . \nsometimes he picked right the first time , and sometimes he made a second choice . \neither way , whether through reincarnation or quick human perception , the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise , perceptive leader . \n>from this point on , the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama\'s spirit and the future leader of a nation . \nit is a great weight to put on the mind of a child . \nin the u . s . it might be grounds for a call to social services . \nbut the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage . \nneither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable , well-rounded person . \ncertain patterns take shape over the years . \nfor example , the dalai lama is fascinated by technology . \nradios , clocks , and telescopes are some of his favorite toys . \nwhen he is old enough to accept his leadership , he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet . \nhe also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain , including herd animals . \nit\'s nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter . \nbut the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet\'s gigantic neighbor , china . \ntibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china , as , first the propaganda , then the political pressure , and finally the armies , come across their common border . \nthe chinese invasion is so successful that the lama\'s life is in danger if he stays . \nthe movie ends when , after much agonizing , the dalai lama leaves tibet for india . \nthe story doesn\'t lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do . \nit just doesn\'t fit that mold . \nif it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie ( perhaps more like seven years in tibet , which is good in its own right ) . \nthe pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that . \nthe structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events , not vice-versa . \nperhaps because the pace is slower , we have more time to notice the beautiful art , vestments , and architecture of tibet . \na mandala , ( tibetan sand painting ) with beautiful , vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie . \nthe robes and hats of state are bright red and gold . \nthe bricks are a rich reddish brown , not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans . \neven the touchstone pictures logo before the movie ( which is usually light blue ) is the red and gold of tibet . \nphilip glass composed the music for kundun , and he was the perfect choice . \nfor those who don\'t know of glass , his music is like a tibetan mandala . \nhis building blocks are lots of small notes , tiny grains of music , which are first grouped , then repeated in patterns . \nthese patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition . \npeople won\'t be flocking to kundun for it\'s great ending , or talking about its outstanding plot , but it does have a lot to offer : an interesting lifetime , exotic sights , rich cinematography , and innovative music . \nit gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person . \non top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese , who gives the film a strong , beautiful , consistent look . \n'
?,'robert redford\'s a river runs through it is not a film i watch often . \nit is a masterpiece -- one of the better films of recent years . \nuntil 1994 , it was my second favorite film of all time . \nthe acting and direction is top-notch -- never sappy , always touching . \na friend of mine once reported that he avoided it because \" i was afraid it would just be really politically correct , and tick me off . \" \nall i could do was tell him to go in unbiased , and enjoy . \nit is one of the few movies that has completely reduced me to tears . \nbut certain memories should not often be rereleased -- in the last few shots , you have to cry . \nupon my first viewing i left bawling . \nit is not flawless -- but it is so very good , that you can\'t help but be effected . \nthe opening is dangerously nolstalgic and sentimental -- watching these shots of people who have been dead so long , gives you a feeling of perspective and history observation that you will find in very few other films . \nmartin scorsese once described the movies as a dream state -- like taking dope , and immersing yourself in an alternative world . \nthat is what a river runs through it does . \nit exploits the unique power of cinema to engross you and help to forget your real self . \nboth times i\'ve seen it , its been hard ( again to quote scorsese ) waking up . \nbut the dream is lovely . \n'
?,'richard gere is not one of my favorite actors . \nhowever , i like courtroom dramas , and this film looked good enough to take a chance on . \ni wasn\'t disappointed . \nit wasn\'t a great film , but it was interesting , and took several unexpected turns . \none thing : what\'s with the title ? \nnot only is it extremely forgettable , it doesn\'t really have much to do with the film , as far as i could determine . \nin the long run , it will probably hurt the film , as people won\'t be able to think of or remember it . \nmartin vail ( richard gere ) is a grandiose defense attorney . \nhe loves the money and the fame that go along with defending ( successfully ) rich scum , such as mafia men and drug-dealers . \nonce he sees that the accused killer of a prominent chicago archbishop is a baby-faced alter boy , he wants in on the case , presumably for the press he\'ll get . \nwe soon find out that the prosecutor assigned is a former lover , janet venable ( laura linney ) . \nvail himself is a former prosecutor , and quit because of tensions between himself and the district attorney , played very well by john mahoney ( frasier\'s father on the tv series ) . \nthere is an underlying theme of dichotomy in the movie : people have public faces , and private faces . \nwe see this in the murdered archbishop , in the accused , and , most strongly , defense attorney martin vail . \nrichard gere does a fairly good job . \nat first , he appears to be a money- and attention-grabbing lawyer , with no consideration of the truth . \nbut we see another side , as he becomes a seeker of justice , and comes to believe in his client . \nalfre woodard , as the judge , is capable , though somewhat wasted in a standard role . \nlaura linney also does journeyman work ; nothing spectacular , but acceptable . \nher relationship with vail is believable ; their verbal fencing adds to the film . \nthe actor who playes vail\'s investigator ( unfortunately , i don\'t remember his name ) is quite good . \nhis female assistant ( she looked very familiar , but i can\'t remember where i\'ve seen her ) was also capable , but unspectacular . \nthe best performance in the film was by edward norton . \nhe was excellent , as the timid altar-boy turned alleged \" butcher boy of st . mike\'s \" . \ni was impressed by the depth of the plot ; there are red-herrings , and dead-ends , that in a lesser film would lead to a predictable ending . \ni liked the plot twists the film took , and most of the supporting characters , thus i give primal fear a respectable b+ rating . \n'
?,'anna and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret landon\'s fact based novel the king and i , and it\'s big , expensive and soulless . \nthough good-looking , its lavish sets , fancy costumes and luscious cinematography can do little to compensate for the emotional wasteland that is peter krikes and steve meerson\'s script . \nso much money was spent on pretty pictures that they forgot to actually make the movie interesting . \nthis is jodie foster\'s first movie since the jaw-droppingly brilliant contact came out more than two years ago and it isn\'t the best choice to show off her acting chops . \nshe\'s trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens , the uptight , widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam ( now thailand ) with her son to instruct the king\'s ( chow yun-fat ) son in the ways of the west ( because \" the ways of england are the ways of the world ) . \nthe king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the whole royal family ( 58 kids with 10 more in the way ; impressive , no ? ) . \nthe eldest prince is none too happy about this ( \" father , have i offended you in some way ? \nwhy do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher ? ) , but soon gets to know anna and her stern- mother-who-loves-you personality better and comes to like her . \nmeanwhile , siam comes under attack from the neighboring british colony of burma . \nthe king and his close advisors suspect that this is britain\'s doing which arouses suspicion in siam , putting anna in an uncomfortable position . \nshe is not sure what to make of this and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis but works to diffuse the king\'s prejudices . \nhe , though self-righteous as ever , can\'t help but be influenced by the eloquent anna and they slowly , quietly , develop affections for each other . \nthere is a scene in the middle of anna and the king where one of the king\'s younger daughters dies . \nit\'s your classic deathbed scene , with the girl\'s mournful eyes staring at her father , who tries only semi- successfully to maintain his composure . \nanna then comes in and cries a bit . \nthe sequence was there for a purpose : to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer . \ni\'m usually a sucker for such scenes and yet this time , i was just sitting there , my emotions untouched . \nthis remains true through all of the movie which remains emotionally barren . \nwe never develop connections to the characters ; never given a reason to care . \nthis ludicrously long epic was directed by andy tennant , whose last film was ever after , one of my favorites of 1998 . \ni do not doubt tennant\'s ability to put together a decent movie , but anna and the king , aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically deficient . \nthe sets and scenery are gorgeous , but the camerawork does nothing to convey its grandeur . \neven terrence malick managed to do more with flora and fauna in his otherwise abysmal the thin red line than tennant can muster from $75 million worth of props and a shoot in malaysia . \nwe feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view ; there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with larger-than-life awe . \ni liked both foster and yun-fat , who give entertaining if not terribly involving performances in the two lead roles . \nfoster\'s generally stoic persona serves her well here , as she is playing a reserved , formal and rather underdeveloped character . \nyun-fat is especially effective , perfectly conveying the king of siam\'s sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts . \nwhat does anna and the king in is its inability to involve the viewer in its characters and situations . \nthe cast is great , the director is talented , and the budget is lavish , but this ill-advised remake of the classic rogers and hammerstein movie is unable to utilize any of those things to form a compelling whole . \nthis is an emotionless costume epic . \n'

?,'i rented this movie with very high hopes . \nthis movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998 , and unfortunately , was not as good as i hoped , but was still very intriguing and thought provoking . \nfirst of all , the casting for this film is great . \ntobey maguire and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood . \nthey play their roles as the parker brother and sister perfectly . \nwith a plot as unbelievable as this film , you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast . \ntobey and reese ( bud and mary sue parker ) play their roles perfectly and display their characters with honesty and believability . \nwilliam h . macy , an actor i have grown to love over the past year , turns in another great performance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife , a \" colored \" person and his friends , the \" non-colored \" ones . \nhe also displays believability and must display a certain lack of chemistry with his wife . \nhe does this perfectly and yet again shows why he should be one of the top actors in hollywood . \njoan allen is equally great as betty parker , the ideal tv mom . \nher character is the most ambitious . \nshe is very na ? ve , and must display this well to make her character believable and she does just that . \nher lack of chemistry with macy , which the role calls for , and her developed chemistry with jeff daniels is terrific , and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest of the cast , then this film would even been even better . \nas said before , jeff daniels gives a bad performance . \nhis character displays the change going on throughout the town , yet he does not display it with enough conviction . \nhis character is very confusing and he is not very believable . \nthis film could have been elevated to a whole new level had daniels been able to give a better performance . \nthe movie is very provocative . \nit challenges the issues of racism that existed in the past and that still exist today . \ni really was not expecting all of the elements they brought up , but they pulled them off with such flair that it was mind blowing . \nthey demonstrate the racism issue without a hitch , but do it in a slow pace . \nthe only major flaw in the film besides the performance by daniels is length . \nsome films are not meant to be that long . \npleasantville is one of those films . \nthis film could have been so much better had they not moved so slowly to it . \nfirst , they are amazed by the implementation of color . \nthen they want to have it . \nthen they do not want to . \nthen the war ensues between the colored and non-colored . \nthis is all strung out over two hours , which was way too long . \nsome movies need a lot of time . \nsaving private ryan was a little bit under three hours long and i thought it could have used more time . \nthis film is only two hours long , and seems much longer . \nlength is everything in films . \nif you can nail down the perfect timing and pace , you can win half the battle . \npleasantville can move at a good pace at times , but it is not consistent enough . \noverall , pleasantville is a very pleasant and provocative departure from the predictability of most films these days . \ni went in expecting a light-hearted film about change . \ni left learning an important lesson about racism and the way things change . \nluckily , pleasantville teaches this lesson in such a way to make it appeal to all audiences . \nonly if it could have done in a shorter amount of time . \n'

?,'this has been an extraordinary year for australian films . \n \" shine \" has just scooped the pool at the australian film institute awards , picking up best film , best actor , best director etc . to that we can add the gritty \" life \" ( the anguish , courage and friendship of a group of male prisoners in the hiv-positive section of a jail ) and \" love and other catastrophes \" ( a low budget gem about straight and gay love on and near a university campus ) . \ni can\'t recall a year in which such a rich and varied celluloid library was unleashed from australia . \n \" shine \" was one bookend . \nstand by for the other one : \" dead heart \" . \n>from the opening credits the theme of division is established . \nthe cast credits have clear and distinct lines separating their first and last names . \nbryan | brown . \nin a desert settlement , hundreds of kilometres from the nearest town , there is an uneasy calm between the local aboriginals and the handful of white settlers who live nearby . \nthe local police officer has the task of enforcing \" white man\'s justice \" to the aboriginals . \nthese are people with a proud 40 , 000 year heritage behind them . \nnaturally , this includes their own system of justice ; key to which is \" payback \" . \nan eye for an eye . \nrevenge . \nusually extracted by the spearing through of the recipient\'s thigh . \nbrown , as the officer , manages quite well to keep the balance . \nhe admits that he has to \'bend the rules\' a bit , including actively encouraging at least one brutal \" payback \" . \n ( be warned that this scene , near the start , is not for the squeamish ) . \nthe local priest - an aboriginal , but in the \" white fellas \" church - has a foot on either side of the line . \nhe is , figuratively and literally , in both camps . \nernie dingo brings a great deal of understanding to this role as the man in the middle . \nhe is part churchman and part politician . \nhowever the tension , like the heat , flies and dust , is always there . \nwhilst her husband - the local teacher - is in church , white lady kate ( milliken ) and her aborginal friend tony , ( pedersen ) have gone off into the hills . \nhe takes her to a sacred site , even today strictly men-only . \nshe appears to not know this . \ntony tells her that this is a special place , an initiation place . \nhe then makes love to her , surrounded by ancient rock art . \nthe community finds out about this sacrilegious act and it\'s payback time . \nthe fuse is lit and the brittle inter-racial peace is shattered . \neveryone is affected in the fall out . \nto say more is to give away the details of this finely crafted film . \nsuffice to say it\'s a rewarding experience . \nbryan brown , acting and co-producing , is the pivotal character . \nhis officer is real , human and therefore flawed . \nbrown comments that he expects audiences to feel warmth towards the man , then suddenly feel angry about him . \nit wasn\'t long ago that i visited central australia - ayers rock ( uluru ) and alice springs - for the first time . \nthe wide-screen cinematography shows the dead heart of australia in a way that captures it\'s vicious beauty , but never deteriorates into a moving slide show , in which the gorgeous background dominates those pesky actors in the foreground . \nthe cultural clash has provided the thesis for many a film ; from the western to the birdcage . \nat least three excellent australian films have covered the aboriginal people and the line between them and we anglo-saxon \'invaders\' : \" jedda \" , \" the chant of jimmie blacksmith \" and \" the last wave \" . \nin a year when the race \'debate\' has reared up in australia , it is nourishing to see such an intelligent , non-judgemental film as \" dead heart \" . \nthe aboriginal priest best sums this up . \nhe is asked to say if he is a \" black fella or white fella \" . \n'
?,'this movie is written by the man who is deemed to be \" one of the hottest writers in hollywood \" . \nhe wrote the groundbreaking screenplay for scream ( 8/10 ) , then added the successful i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) \nscript to his mix , and also created the popular tv series \" dawson\'s creek \" . \nso when he asked to direct his first movie , based on his first ever script written , everyone and their grandma said \" sure , go for it ! \" . \nuhhm , my question is . . . did anyone bother reading this stupid script ? ? ? \nplot : ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher in the west , mrs . tingle , and set to lose her scholarship to college . \nwhen she and her friends visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of the story , they end up tying her up , and slowly trying to talk some sense into the hardheaded woman . \ncritique : it\'s not so much that this is a bad movie , than the fact that it sucks . \nthis movie is chock-full of one-dimensional characters , contains no actual humor that i was able to zone in on , zero tension or thrills , plot holes the size of my big ass , lame pop tunes played to mask nothing going on in the movie , and molly ringwald , vivica a . fox and lesley anne warren tossed away in throwaway roles . \ni was primed for this film as its interesting premise had me thinking misery ( 8/10 ) and 9 to 5 , but unfortunately for williamson , he went nowhere with the bright foundation , making references to the exorcist and dr . \nzhivago , which i doubt many in his target market will appreciate . \nhe also forgot about suspense , with all of his characters based on incomprehensible decisions , unbelievable motivations and simply boring us with all of their trite dialogue . \nsure , katie holmes is cute , and her co-star , marisa coughlan , did a reasonably amusing impression of the exorcist ( worth two points out of my three on ten ) , but how can we forgive the biggest one-dimensional character in any film , holmes\' rival in the film , mrs . tingle\'s complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others around her ( are teachers allowed to behave that way nowadays ? ) and a transparent romance between holmes and some long-haired dude , hired to be the poor man\'s version of skeet ulrich ( who himself is a poor man\'s version of johnny depp ! ) . \nall in all , this movie was laughable for me , provided me with no insight into anything , demonstrated williamson\'s genuine lack of directorial skills alongside a juvenile script , and provided helen mirren with a great role to chew into , unfortunately forgetting to give her character any believability , humanity or capacity to comprehend . \nno hip lines , no cheap thrills , just a dull time at the movie theater . \nif you want to see a funny teenage movie , go see detroit rock city ( 8/10 ) , and thank my drunken , sorry ass in the morning . \nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : kevin williamson\'s father was a fisherman . \nkevin used his knowledge of fishing hooks and winches when creating the killer in i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) . \nhe is also a huge fan of steven spielberg and coincidentally , so is dawson leery on tv\'s \" dawson\'s creek \" , a show kevin created . \nhe was once an aspiring actor . \nin fact , he even landed a bit part on tv\'s \" another world \" . \nalso , williamson has gone on record to say that an unsupportive english teacher who once told him that he would never amount to anything was the inspiration for mrs . tingle , which is also loosely based on the book \" killing mr . griffin \" by the writer of i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) , \nlois duncan . \nhe has also come out and said that he is a gay man . \nhelen mirren was born in london , england under the name ilynea lydia mironoff . \nshe is married to director taylor hackford , whose works include devil\'s advocate ( 8/10 ) and an officer and a gentleman ( 8 . 5/10 ) . \nthis film was originally titled killing mrs . \ntingle , but was changed after the columbine high school shooting incident . \nactress marisa coughlan will star in kevin williamson next tv project called \" wasteland \" . \nthis is actor barry watson first full feature film . \nhe has played the character of \" seth \" on tv\'s \" malibu shores \" several times . \n'
?,'wow ! what a movie . \nit\'s everything a movie can be : funny , dramatic , interesting , weird , funny , weird and strikingly original . \nyep that pretty much describes this movie . \nit starts out like a regular movie and ends up being one of the weirdest , funniest most original movies i have ever seen . \nit boggles the mind and some have to wonder why we cannot get movies like this more often . \nbesides being one of the best films of the year , being john malkovich may as well be one of the best movies ever . \nperiod . \nthen again there are so many good movies , that one cannot pick an all time favorite . \njohn cusack plays a puppeteer craig schwartz a man out of a job , in search of a job . \nhis wife lotte schwartz who is played by a completely un-noticeable cameron diaz who looks like something off the streets is an animal lover and has about every kind of animal you could think of . \ncraig finds a job as a file at the 7 ? floor of a business building . . . you \nhave to pry open the elevator doors open before it reaches floor eight , the 7 ? floor is just a floor between 7 and 8 . \nhe is hired by his 105 year old boss ( orsen bean ) to be a filer . \nin his office , he discovers a little door , to which was boarded up and hidden . \nto his curiosity he opens it and starts to crawl toward it , he then gets sucked to the end and ends up in john malkovich\'s mind . \nfifteen minutes later he is shot out onto the side of the new jersey turnpike . \nhe returns to tell his co-worker maxine ( catherine keener ) that he has found a portal that will lead him into john malkovich\'s mind , she doesn\'t believe him but after she sees it it changes her mind . \nlotte also finds out about the portal and discovers that being someone else is good after all . \njohn malkovich of course has no idea what is going on , and by the end of this bizarre film there are so many twists and turns , that we don\'t know what really happened . \njohn cusack is outstanding and utterly believeable in a role only he himself could play . \nhe fits the role perfectly and to me was brilliantly cast . \ncameron diaz is outstanding and utterly one of the world\'s most prettiest women , is made up here unnoticeable and very unattractive . \nshe however gives a very comic performance and this could easily be her best role to date . \ncatherine keener is very funny and sexy as maxine and of course the best thing of the movie is the magic himself john malkovich who is very brilliant and this movie plays big time homage ? to the master himself . \nthe whole group combined gives us a wonderfully funny movie that is also smart and clever . \nspike jonze ( three kings ) makes his fabulous directing debut , and did a fantastic job of directing this new classic film . \nhe lets the viewer go on the trip as well as let the viewer know they are watching a movie . \nby the time the ending rolled around my head was spinning from disbelief of how good this film was . \nthe screenplay written by charlie kaufman was hilarious and often thought-provoking . \nthe film also had a soft side to it and even though the ending is very surprising it is also a little sad and heart-warming . \nthe whole movie was fantastic and had me rolling in the isles . \nfrom cameron diaz\'s appearence to john malkovich\'s explorations i laughed very hard , and it may as well be as funny as as good as it gets ( the funniest ! ) . \nthere isn\'t a slow point in the movie , or an overused idea . \nthere are no cliches except for the fact that this is the most original , inventie , witty , and smart movie i\'ve seen in a long time . \ni found myself amazed by everything : the direction , acting , writing and the whole idea of the movie . \nby the end i had to wonder why hollywood doesn\'t want to make movies like this anymore . \nor why they don\'t . \nall filmmakers watch this movie and get some ideas of movies to come out . \nthis was a surprise hit as was american beauty . \n\'being john malkovich\' is in the top 5 movies of the year , and in the top 10 best films ever made . \nit has something that no other movies playing now has . \nin fact it may as well be the best movie out right now . \ni highly recommend \'being john malkovich\' and have no doubts you will be disappointed . \n'

?,'there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director . \nof course , his best film was 1978\'s masterpiece , \" halloween , \" but he also made 1980\'s \" the fog , \" and 1987\'s underrated , \" prince of darkness . \" \nheck , he even made a good film in 1995 , with \" in the mouth of madness . \" \nbut something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992 , with the terrible comedy , \" memoirs of an invisible man . \" \nsomehow , carpenter has lost his touch , with junk like his failed 1995 remake of , \" village of the damned , \" to his uninspired 1996 sequel , \" escape from l . a . \" those movies , however , look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film , \" john carpenter\'s vampires . \" \nif i was him , i definately wouldn\'t want to put my own name in the title . \nit is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as , \" vampires . \" \nthe story is simple . \njack crow ( james woods ) is a vampire hunter who , along with one of his partners , montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and a prostitute , katrina ( sheryl lee ) , survives an attack from the master vampire , valek ( thomas ian griffith ) . \nsince katrina was previously bitten by him , crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later , and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her . \nit seems valek\'s mission is to steal a black , wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him . \nmy question is : how many time have we seen this same story played out ? \nwell , the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made . \n \" john carpenter\'s vampires , \" sadly enough , is one of the most unscary horror films i\'ve ever seen . \nin fact , there isn\'t even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105-minute running time . \nthe non-stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed , without any interesting camera work , which is usually a trademark of carpenter\'s . \nand then we come to the screenplay , which , as far as i can tell , is nearly non-existent . \nthere is no story development , and there isn\'t even an attempt to flesh out the characters . \njames woods can be a good actor , but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of \" pseudo \" -clever lines of dialogue . \ndaniel baldwin has some potential , but his character comes off as being very dense . \nand sheryl lee ( faring much better as laura palmer in \" twin peaks \" ) , like all of the female characters , plays an offensive stereotypical whore . \nthere is not an ounce of intelligence , or excitement in , \" john carpenter\'s vamires , \" which is very disheartening coming from an ex-fan of carpenter\'s . \nhe has said that he turned down directing , \" halloween : h20 , \" because he couldn\'t work up any excitement for it . \nand yet , when asked about a \" vampires \" sequel , he said he would be happy to do it . \ni think that\'s a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent , not to mention a significant number of iq points . \n'
